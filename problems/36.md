36. Valid Sudoku
```
Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.


A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. iterate the board, if the spot is non-empty, build a set of values in its row, col and cell, if the spot value is in the set, return false, else move to next spot. if all spot checks pass, return True.

2. go through 9 rows, 9 cols, 9 cells, if all pass return true.
```


my solution:
```
