110. Balanced Binary Tree
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. recursion.
if n is bbt -> n.left is bbt and n.right is bbt
base case:
n is leaf or none ** wrong base case
n has no child, n has one leaf child, n has two leaf children
** too complicated

2. find abs|depth(left) - depth(right)|
```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not root:
            return True
        self.res = True
        def dep(n):
            if not n:
                return -1
            if not self.res:
                return 0
            l = dep(n.left)
            r = dep(n.right)
            
            if abs(l-r)>1:
                self.res = False
            return max(l, r) +1
        dep(root)
        return self.res
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 68ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

1. combined base case and global var in function, 59ms, the problem with this is that it has to travel the whole tree even the first branch is unbalanced:
class Solution(object):
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def maxDepth(root):
            if not root: return 0
            l = maxDepth(root.left)
            if l<0: return -1
            r=maxDepth(root.right)
            if r<0: return -1
            if abs(l-r)>1: return -1 
            return 1+max(l, r)
        
        return maxDepth(root)>=0 
```
