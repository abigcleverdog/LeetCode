406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
```
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.


Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

my thoughts:
```
1. sort the tuple according to height first, if height is same, sort by k. place the person into the queue from the tallest to the shortest, for people with same height, place the person with smaller k first, as for current person, no later person can be taller, or same height with smaller k, we have to place him/her at the kth position in the current queue to satisfy the k.
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

lambda expression
list.insert(idx, val)

1. same idea, neat implementation, 118ms:
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        people.sort(key=lambda (h, k): (-h, k))
        queue = []
        for p in people:
            queue.insert(p[1], p)
        return queue
