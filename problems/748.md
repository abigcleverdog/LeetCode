748. Shortest Completing Word
```
Find the minimum length word from a given dictionary words, which has all the letters from the string licensePlate. Such a word is said to complete the given string licensePlate

Here, for letters we ignore case. For example, "P" on the licensePlate still matches "p" on the word.

It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, return the one that occurs first in the array.

The license plate might have the same letter occurring multiple times. For example, given a licensePlate of "PP", the word "pair" does not complete the licensePlate, but the word "supper" does.

Example 1:
Input: licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", words = ["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]
Output: "steps"
Explanation: The smallest length word that contains the letters "S", "P", "S", and "T".
Note that the answer is not "step", because the letter "s" must occur in the word twice.
Also note that we ignored case for the purposes of comparing whether a letter exists in the word.
Example 2:
Input: licensePlate = "1s3 456", words = ["looks", "pest", "stew", "show"]
Output: "pest"
Explanation: There are 3 smallest length words that contains the letters "s".
We return the one that occurred first.
Note:
licensePlate will be a string with length in range [1, 7].
licensePlate will contain digits, spaces, or letters (uppercase or lowercase).
words will have a length in the range [10, 1000].
Every words[i] will consist of lowercase letters, and have length in range [1, 15].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. convert the plate into a checking dict{char: count} ->
iterate words, check if word length is not shorter than the char counts sum and the first valid word of this length hasn't been checked in, copy the checking dict, iterate the word, cross the char if it is in the dict, if the dict is empty, this is a valid word, store it is an array, store its length in a set.
once finished words, return the valid word with shortest length.
```

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def largestValues(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        res = [root.val]
        cur = [root]
        while cur:
            prev = cur
            cur = []
            for n in prev:
                if n.left:
                    cur.append(n.left)
                if n.right:
                    cur.append(n.right)
            if cur:
                res.append(max(n.val for n in cur))
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:
do not need to store all valid word, just update when a shorter one is found

1. N/A
