46. Permutations
```
Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations.

For example,
[1,2,3] have the following permutations:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]
```

my thoughts:
```
1. dfs. use a set to track what has been used. when the cur array has same len as the nums, append cur to res.
```

my solution:
```

    def permute(self, nums):

        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        res = []
        cur = []
        ss = set()
        l = len(nums)
        self.helper(nums, res, cur, ss, l)
        return res
    
    def helper(self, nums, res, cur, ss, l):
        if len(cur) == l:
            res.append(cur[:])
            return
        for n in nums:
            if n not in ss:
                ss.add(n)
                cur.append(n)
                self.helper(nums, res, cur, ss, l)
                ss.remove(n)
                cur.pop()
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. a little hard to understand from the code but more intuitive mathmatically. pick the first n1 (any from nums), it has only one position to go, now we have [n1]; pick a n2 (any from rest), it has two positions can go, now we have [n1, n2] and [n2, n1]; pick n3, three positons can go for each of previous result, now we have [n1,n2,n3], [n1,n3,n2], [n3,n1,n2] + [n2,n1,n3], [n2,n3,n1], [n3,n2,n1]... , 69ms:
