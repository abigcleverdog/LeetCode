205. Isomorphic Strings
```
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. for both strs, build an arr same length as the str. iterate the str, if the char has not been seen, put the index of the char in the arr; if it has been seen, put down the index where this is first seen.
compare the to arr, if two arr are identical then true.
```


my solution:
```
**********62ms
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(s) != len(t): return False
        l = len(s)
        ds = {}
        ss = [0]*l
        dt = {}
        tt = [0]*l
        for i,c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in ds:
                ds[c] = i
                ss[i] = i
            else:
                ss[i] = ds[c]
        for i,c in enumerate(t):
            if c not in dt:
                dt[c] = i
                tt[i] = i
            else:
                tt[i] = dt[c]
        i = 0
        while i<l:
            if ss[i]!=tt[i]:
                return False
            i += 1
        return True
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

zip([iterable, ...])
This function returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence. When there are multiple arguments which are all of the same length, zip() is similar to map() with an initial argument of None. With a single sequence argument, it returns a list of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns an empty list.

The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups using zip(*[iter(s)]*n).

zip() in conjunction with the * operator can be used to unzip a list:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> zipped
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
>>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
True


1. use the zip function, 38ms:
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return len(set(zip(s, t))) == len(set(s)) == len(set(t))
		
2. same idea with mine, but better implementation, 39ms:
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        maps = {}
        values = set()
        index = 0
        for i in s:
            if i in maps:
                if t[index] != maps[i]:
                    return False
            else:
                maps[i] = t[index]
                values.add(t[index])
            index += 1
        
        if len(values) != len(maps):
            return False
        
        return True
```
