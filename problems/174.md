174. Dungeon Game
```
The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.


Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

-2 (K)	-3	3
-5	-10	1
10	30	-5 (P)

Notes:

The knight's health has no upper bound.
Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

my thoughts:
```
1. 1d or 2d dp.
	-2	-3	3
	-5	-10	1
	10	3	-5
	-11	2	-3

0	-2,-2	-5,-5	-5,-2
0	-7,-7	-15,-15	-5,-1
0	-7,3	-7,6	-7,1
0	-8,-8	-7,8	-7,5

(x, y) for each step, x is the min consumption (max non positive val) to reach this step; y is the max accumulation till this step.
if step is positive, compare up and left see which is easier to reach, if step is negative, compare the min(up accumulation + this step val, up consumption) and the min(left accumulation + this step val, left consumption)
** too complicated...

2. dfs + mem. go through each path, track the min sum along the path.
O((m+n)!/m!/n!) for dfs probably going to TLE
with mem, O(m*n) a little tricky to set the mem

3. 2d dp from backward.
	-2		-3		3
	Y6		Y5		X6
	-5		-10		1
	Y4		Y3		X5
	10		3		-5
	Y2		Y1		X4
	-11		2		-3
	X3		X2		X1

X1: -3; X2: X1+2 = -1; X3: X2+(-11) = -12 -- needs 12 health to start from X3 and go X1.
X4: X1+(-5) = -8; X5: X4+1 = -7; X6: X5+3 = -4

Y1: 3+max(X2,X4)=2->0; Y2: 10+max(X3,Y1)=10->0; Y3: -10+max(Y1,X5)=-10; Y4: -5+max(Y2,Y3)=-5; Y5: -3+max(Y3,X6)=-7; Y6: -2+max(Y4,Y5)=-7 -- needs 7 health to go from Y6 to X1
*tricky part: the knight needs to end up with at least 1 hp.

        return 1-dp[0][0] if dp[0][0]<0 else 1
