384. Shuffle an Array
```
Shuffle a set of numbers without duplicates.

Example:

// Init an array with set 1, 2, and 3.
int[] nums = {1,2,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result. Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned.
solution.shuffle();

// Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3].
solution.reset();

// Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3].
solution.shuffle();
```

my thoughts:
```
1. for each num in the nums, randomly select a num from the rest undetermined idx to swap.
```

my solution:
```

class Solution(object):
    import random

    def __init__(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        """
        self.nums = nums

    def reset(self):
        """
        Resets the array to its original configuration and return it.
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        return self.nums

    def shuffle(self):
        """
        Returns a random shuffling of the array.
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = self.nums[:]
        l = len(self.nums)
        for i in range(l):
            r = random.randint(i,l-1)
            res[i], res[r] = res[r], res[i]
        return res


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(nums)
# param_1 = obj.reset()
# param_2 = obj.shuffle()
```

my comments:
```

Do not quite get why can I just randomly select a idx from the whole list every time. Maybe it is mathmatically tested.

from other ppl's solution:

1. N/A
