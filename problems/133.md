133. Clone Graph
```
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

my thoughts:
```
1. map the graph and construct a new one according to the map.
```

my solution:

        if not node:
            return
        visited = {}
        cur = [node]
        while cur:
            next_cur = []
            for n in cur:
                if n.label not in visited:
                    visited[n.label] = n.neighbors
                    next_cur.extend(n.neighbors)
            cur = next_cur
            
        res = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        cur = [res]
        while cur:
            next_cur = []
            for n in cur:
                if n.label in visited:
                    n.neighbors = [UndirectedGraphNode(i.label) for i in visited[n.label]]
                    next_cur.extend(n.neighbors)
                    visited.pop(n.label)
            cur = next_cur
        
        return res
