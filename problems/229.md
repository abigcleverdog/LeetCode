229. Majority Element II
```
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times. The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

my solution:
```
********** 
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not nums:
            return []
        l = len(nums)
        m1, m2 = nums[0], nums[0] + 1
        count1 = count2 = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == m1:
                count1 += 1
            elif n == m2:
                count2 += 1
            elif count1 == 0:
                m1 = n
                count1 += 1
            elif count2 == 0:
                m2 = n
                count2 += 1
            else:
                count2 -= 1
                count1 -= 1
        print(m1, count1, m2, count2)
        res = []
        count1 = count2 = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == m1:
                count1 += 1
            if n == m2:
                count2 += 1
        if count1 > l // 3:
            res.append(m1)
        if count2 > l // 3:
            res.append(m2)
            
        return res
```

my comments:

from other ppl's solution:

1. For those who aren’t familiar with Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm,
I found a great article (http://goo.gl/64Nams) that helps me to understand this fantastic algorithm!!
Please check it out!

The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. If you find a number Y that is not X, the current counter should deduce 1. The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. This could be explained as “4 X being paired out by 4 Y”.

And since the requirement is finding the majority for more than ceiling of [n/3], the answer would be less than or equal to two numbers.
So we can modify the algorithm to maintain two counters for two majorities.

Followings are my sample Python code:

class Solution:
# @param {integer[]} nums
# @return {integer[]}
def majorityElement(self, nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    count1, count2, candidate1, candidate2 = 0, 0, 0, 1
    for n in nums:
        if n == candidate1:
            count1 += 1
        elif n == candidate2:
            count2 += 1
        elif count1 == 0:
            candidate1, count1 = n, 1
        elif count2 == 0:
            candidate2, count2 = n, 1
        else:
            count1, count2 = count1 - 1, count2 - 1
    return [n for n in (candidate1, candidate2)
                    if nums.count(n) > len(nums) // 3]
```
