414. Third Maximum Number
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

Example 1:
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. remove duplicates. if cannot find the 3rd maximum, return 1st maximum; otherwise, update the first 3 maximums while iterate the array
```


my solution:
```
**********35ms
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums = list(set(nums))
        if len(nums)<3:
            return max(nums)
        m1 = nums[0]
        m2 = nums[1]
        m3 = nums[2]
        if m1<m2:
            m1, m2 = m2, m1
        if m1<m3:
            m1, m3 = m3, m1
        if m2<m3:
            m2, m3 = m3, m2
        i = 3
        l = len(nums)
        while i<l:
            if nums[i]>m1:
                m3, m2, m1 = m2, m1, nums[i]
            elif nums[i]>m2:
                m3, m2 = m2, nums[i]
            elif nums[i]>m3:
                m3 = nums[i]
            i += 1
        return m3   
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. do not have to remove duplicates or pre-populate the first 3 maximums, 28ms:
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, list):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        first_max = None
        second_max = None
        third_max = None
        for member in list:
            if member > first_max:
                third_max = second_max
                second_max = first_max
                first_max = member
            elif member > second_max and first_max != member:
                third_max = second_max
                second_max = member
            elif member > third_max and second_max != member and first_max != member:
                third_max = member
        if third_max == None:
            return first_max
        return third_max
```
