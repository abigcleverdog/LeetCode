338. Counting Bits
```
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

my thoughts:
```
1. double the list as the second half is adding 1 to every element the first half.
```


my solution:
```
**********192ms
class Solution(object):
    def countBits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = [0]
        while num>len(res)-1:
            _res = []
            for n in res:
                _res.append(n + 1)
            res.extend(_res)            
        return res[:num+1]
```

my comments:
```
i & 1 checks if the bit of i ends with 1.

from other ppl's solution:

1. This is the fastest one, 165ms:
class Solution(object):
    def countBits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = [0] * (num + 1)  
        for i in range(1,num + 1):  
            res[i] = res[i/2] + (i & 1)  
        return res  
```
