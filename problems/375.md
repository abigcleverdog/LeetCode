375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
```
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

1. ...
2d dp

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def getMoneyAmount(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        def calc(dp, s, e):
            if s >= e:
                return 0
            if dp[s][e] != 0:
                return dp[s][e]
            res = n * n
            for i in range(s, e):
                temp = i + max(calc(dp, s, i - 1), calc(dp, i + 1, e))
                if temp < res:
                    res = temp
            dp[s][e] = res
            return res
            
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        return calc(dp, 1, n)
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. For each number x in range[i~j]
we do: result_when_pick_x = x + max{DP([i~x-1]), DP([x+1, j])}
–> // the max means whenever you choose a number, the feedback is always bad and therefore leads you to a worse branch.
then we get DP([i~j]) = min{xi, … ,xj}
–> // this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost.

public class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] table = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return DP(table, 1, n);
    }
    
    int DP(int[][] t, int s, int e){
        if(s >= e) return 0;
        if(t[s][e] != 0) return t[s][e];
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int x=s; x<=e; x++){
            int tmp = x + Math.max(DP(t, s, x-1), DP(t, x+1, e));
            res = Math.min(res, tmp);
        }
        t[s][e] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
Here is a bottom up solution.

public class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] table = new int[n+1][n+1];
        for(int j=2; j<=n; j++){
            for(int i=j-1; i>0; i--){
                int globalMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for(int k=i+1; k<j; k++){
                    int localMax = k + Math.max(table[i][k-1], table[k+1][j]);
                    globalMin = Math.min(globalMin, localMax);
                }
                table[i][j] = i+1==j?i:globalMin;
            }
        }
        return table[1][n];
    }
}
```
