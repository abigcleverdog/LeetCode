101. Symmetric Tree
```
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. preorder recusion. merge root, then root.left, then root.right
```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def mergeTrees(self, t1, t2):
        """
        :type t1: TreeNode
        :type t2: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not t1 and not t2:
            return
        if not t1:
            return t2
        if not t2:
            return t1
        s = t1.val + t2.val
        t1.val = s
        t2.val = s
        t1.left = self.mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left)
        t1.right = self.mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right)
        return t1
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. Do not need to alter t2, 99ms:
class Solution(object):
    def mergeTrees(self, t1, t2):
        """
        :type t1: TreeNode
        :type t2: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if t1 is None and t2 is None:
            return None
        if t1 is None:
            return t2
        if t2 is None:
            return t1
        t1.val += t2.val
        t1.left = self.mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left)
        t1.right = self.mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right)
        return t1

```
