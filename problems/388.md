388. Longest Absolute File Path
```
Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:

dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:
The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..
Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.

Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.

my thoughts:
```
1. dfs.
```

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        def dfs(res, cur, n):
            if cur > n:
                return
            else:
                res.append(cur)
                for i in range(10):
                    if cur * 10 + i > n:
                        return
                    dfs(res, cur * 10 + i, n)
        for i in range(1, 10):
            dfs(res, i, n)
        return res
```

my comments:

from other ppl's solution:

1. The idea is pretty simple. If we look at the order we can find out we just keep adding digit from 0 to 9 to every digit and make it a tree.
Then we visit every node in pre-order. 
       1        2        3    ...
      /\        /\       /\
   10 ...19  20...29  30...39   ....

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=1;i<10;++i){
          dfs(i, n, res); 
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    public void dfs(int cur, int n, List<Integer> res){
        if(cur>n)
            return;
        else{
            res.add(cur);
            for(int i=0;i<10;++i){
                if(10*cur+i>n)
                    return;
                dfs(10*cur+i, n, res);
            }
        }
    }
}

2. Simple. easy to understand. No fking weird, rarely used built-int functions.

class Solution(object):
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        ans = [1]
        while len(ans) < n:
            new = ans[-1] * 10
            while new > n:
                new /= 10
                new += 1
                while new % 10 == 0:    # deal with case like 199+1=200 when we need to restart from 2.
                    new /= 10
            ans.append(new)    
        return ans
		
3. public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(n);
        int curr = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            list.add(curr);
            if (curr * 10 <= n) {
                curr *= 10;
            } else if (curr % 10 != 9 && curr + 1 <= n) {
                curr++;
            } else {
                while ((curr / 10) % 10 == 9) {
                    curr /= 10;
                }
                curr = curr / 10 + 1;
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
The basic idea is to find the next number to add.
Take 45 for example: if the current number is 45, the next one will be 450 (450 == 45 * 10)(if 450 <= n), or 46 (46 == 45 + 1) (if 46 <= n) or 5 (5 == 45 / 10 + 1)(5 is less than 45 so it is for sure less than n).
We should also consider n = 600, and the current number = 499, the next number is 5 because there are all "9"s after “4” in “499” so we should divide 499 by 10 until the last digit is not “9”.
It is like a tree, and we are easy to get a sibling, a left most child and the parent of any node.
