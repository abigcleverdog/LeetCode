388. Longest Absolute File Path
```
Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:

dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:
The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..
Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.

Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. use a stack to keep length of each level (this may derive into keep the actual path)
```

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def lengthLongestPath(self, input):
        """
        :type input: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_l = 0
        stack = [-1]
        ls = input.split('\n')
        for s in ls:
            lev = s.count('\t') + 1
            s = s.strip('\t')
            while lev < len(stack):
                stack.pop()
            cur_l = len(s) + stack[-1] + 1
            if '.' in s:
                if cur_l > max_l:
                    max_l = cur_l
            else:
                stack.append(cur_l)
        return max_l
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. The number of tabs is my depth and for each depth I store the current path length.

def lengthLongestPath(self, input):
    maxlen = 0
    pathlen = {0: 0}
    for line in input.splitlines():
        name = line.lstrip('\t')
        depth = len(line) - len(name)
        if '.' in name:
            maxlen = max(maxlen, pathlen[depth] + len(name))
        else:
            pathlen[depth + 1] = pathlen[depth] + len(name) + 1
    return maxlen
	
2. @StefanPochmann great job, I was only able to do this

class Solution(object):
    def lengthLongestPath(self, input):
        paths, max_length, length, depth = [], 0, 0, 0
        for line in input.split("\n"):
            now_depth = collections.Counter(line)['\t']
            name = line.strip('\t')
            if now_depth <= depth and paths:
                for k in range(depth - now_depth + 1):
                    last = paths.pop()
                    length -= len(last)
                    if "." not in last:
                        length -= 1
            paths.append(name)
            length += len(name)
            if "." in name:
                max_length = max(max_length, length)
            else:
                length += 1
            depth = now_depth
        return max_length
		
3. Split the string using ‘\n’ to get all directories and files. For each item, the number of ‘\t’ is how deep the item is.

List slice assignment is our good friend to build the whole path.

Thanks to @StefanPochmann , I have corrected the time complexity of the code. Here is the O(n) version:

class Solution(object):
    def lengthLongestPath(self, input):
        path, maxLen = [], 0
        for s in input.split('\n'):
            path[s.count('\t'):] = [len(s.strip('\t'))]
            maxLen = max(maxLen, sum(path)+len(path)-1 if '.' in s else 0)
        return maxLen
		
4. Slightly longer version. But I think is way easier to understand.

Only need -1 when it’s at root dir.
Only add to stack if it isn’t an executable file.
public static int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(0);  // Layer 0, dummy head
    int maxLen = 0;
    for(String s : input.split("\n")) {
        int layer = s.lastIndexOf("\t") + 1;    // e.g. Layer 2 s: "\t\tsubsubdir1"
        while(layer < stack.size() - 1)
            stack.pop();
        int length = stack.peek() + s.length() - layer + 1; // remove "\t\t..." add "\"
        if(layer == 0)  // dir has no "\t" in the front
            length--;
        if(s.contains("."))
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, length);
        else
            stack.push(length);
    }
    return maxLen;
}
