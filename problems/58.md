58. length of Last Word
```
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

my thoughts:
```
1. seems straightforward, just be careful of special cases
```


my solution:
```
**********32ms
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not s:
            return 0
        s = s.strip().split(' ')
        if len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        return len(s[-1])
```

my comments:
```
str.strip() to remove leading and tailing white spaces
