63. Unique Paths II
```
Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

my thoughts:
```
1. dp. 2d dp is straight forward. 
time: O(n*m); 		 O(n*m) 
```

my solution:
```

class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not obstacleGrid or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        h = len(obstacleGrid)
        w = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        dp = [[0]*w for i in range(h)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, w):
            if obstacleGrid[0][i] == 0:
                dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1]
        for i in range(1, h):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
                dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]

                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                    
        return dp[-1][-1]

from other ppl's solution:

1. 1d dp, 49ms:
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        rowprev = [0 for i in obstacleGrid[0]]
        rowcurr = [0 for i in obstacleGrid[0]]
        rowprev[0] = 1
        for row in obstacleGrid:
            for i, cell in enumerate(row):
                if cell == 1:
                    rowcurr[i] = 0
                else:
                    rowcurr[i] = ((rowcurr[i-1]) if i > 0 else 0) + rowprev[i]
            rowprev, rowcurr = rowcurr, rowprev
        return rowprev[-1]
