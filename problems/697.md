697. Degree of an Array
```
Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Note:

nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. a) iterate the array. build a {num : count} dict ->
b) find the max count, store all num that has max count is a set ->
c) iterate the array, for each num in the set, find the distance between the first appearance and the last appearance ->
d) return the min distance

** messed up c) in first try, as I was trying to use only left pointer and reset the right pointer to the end of the array for each new num. This leads to a possible O(n^2) run time and There was a 'Time Limit Exceeded' during submission
The problem was solved by breaking c) down more carefully:
c) 1' iterate the array from left, find the first appearance for all num_maxcount in the set, build a {num_maxcount : l_pointer} dict ->
2' iterate the array from right, find the last appearance for all num_maxcount in the dict, update the dict to be {num_maxcount: length}
```


my solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        d = {}
        for n in nums:
            d[n] = 1 if n not in d else d[n]+1
        ns = set()
        maxc = 0
        for n in d:
            if d[n] == maxc:
                ns.add(n)
            if d[n] > maxc:
                maxc = d[n]
                ns.clear()
                ns.add(n)
        l = 0
        minl = len(nums)
        nsr = ns.copy()
        d2 = {}
        while ns:
            while nums[l] not in ns:
                l = l+1                
            ns.remove(nums[l])
            d2[nums[l]] = l
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while nsr:
            while nums[r] not in nsr:
                r = r-1
            nsr.remove(nums[r])
            d2[nums[r]] = r - d2[nums[r]] + 1
        return min(d2.values())
        
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 76ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

d[n] = 1 if n not in d else d[n]+1
can be:
d[n] = d.get(n, 0) + 1

1. better array munipulation, 96 ms:
	
class Solution(object):
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right, count = {},{},{}
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x not in left:
                left[x] = i
            right[x] = i
            count[x] = count.get(x,0)+1
        ans = len(nums)
        degree = max(count.values())
        for k,v in count.items():
            if v == degree:
                ans = min(ans, right.get(k)-left.get(k)+1)
        return ans
```
