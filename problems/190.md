190. Reverse Bits
```
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

my thoughts:
```
1. not quite familiar with bit manipulation. just the basic: convert n to bit (32 digits), reverse the bit, convert the bit back to an integer
```


my solution:
```
**********42ms
class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        res = bin(n)[2:]
        z = 32 - len(res)
        res = '0'*z + res
        res = res[::-1]
        return int(res, 2)
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. one liner, 28ms:
class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    
    # The binary equivalent of 5 is: 0b101, The prefix 0b represents that the result is a binary string. int(x, 2) int to binary
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        return int(bin(n)[2:].zfill(32)[::-1], 2)
```
