526. Beautiful Arrangement
```
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

my thoughts:
```
1. find candidates for each idx, combine to generate all possibilities, count.
stuck at combine to generate all possibilities.

```


my solution:
```
**********29ms
class Solution(object):
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        i = j = 0
        count = 0
        l = len(A)
        while i+2<l:
            if A[i]-A[i+1] == A[i+1]-A[i+2]:
                j = i+3
                while j<l:
                    if A[i]-A[i+1] == A[j-1]-A[j]:
                        j += 1
                    else:
                        break
                count += (j-i-2)*(j-i-1)/2
                i = j
            else:
                i += 1
        return count
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. some deep thinking about count, 26ms:
class Solution(object):
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        ret=cnt=0
        for i in xrange(len(A)):
            if i>=2 and A[i]-A[i-1]==A[i-1]-A[i-2]:
                cnt+=1
                ret+=cnt
            else:
                cnt=0
        return ret
```
