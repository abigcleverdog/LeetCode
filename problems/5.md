5. Longest Palindromic Substring
```
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:

Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example:

Input: "cbbd"

Output: "bb"
```

my thoughts:
```
1. iterate the str, for each char, set the left pointer to it and check if the next char is the same, if yes, move the right pointer to the new idx(same char) till a diff is found. update the longest substring with str[left:right+1] is it is longer than what was stored. then check left-i and right+i till a diff is found. move left to right+1
O(n^2)
```

my solution:
```
**********161ms
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not s:
            return ''
        left = right = 0
        l = len(s)
        res = s[0]
        while left<l:
            while right+1<l and s[left] == s[right+1]:
                right += 1                
            i = 1
            while left-i>=0 and right+i<l:
                if s[left-i]==s[right+i]:
                    i += 1                    
                else:
                    break
            if right-left+2*(i-1)+1>len(res):
                res = s[left-i+1:right+i]
            left = right + 1
            right = left
            
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. just focus on the max length of the substring, do not have to check i=1, 2, 3... if we have found a i=10, 82ms:
class Solution:
    # @return a string
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        if len(s)==0:
        	return 0
        maxLen=1
        start=0
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
        	if i-maxLen >=1 and s[i-maxLen-1:i+1]==s[i-maxLen-1:i+1][::-1]:
        		start=i-maxLen-1
        		maxLen+=2
        		continue

        	if i-maxLen >=0 and s[i-maxLen:i+1]==s[i-maxLen:i+1][::-1]:
        		start=i-maxLen
        		maxLen+=1
        return s[start:start+maxLen]
```
