71. Simplify Path
```
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
click to show corner cases.

Corner Cases:
Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
In this case, you should return "/".
Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
```

my thoughts:
```
1. not familiar with unix path rules. thanks to people made it easy to understand.
first extract all the strs from the path; delete all empty strs as well as '.', since it does not do anything; iterate the remaining strs from right, rip off '..' along with the strs in front of it, tricky part is the '..' may be continuous, so use a count to track how may non '..' strs still need to be removed. join the rest wiht '/'. if these is no strs to join, return '/'
```

my solution:
```

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        """
        :type path: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        ps = path.split('/')
        if not ps:
            return '/'
        ps = [c for c in ps if c and c != '.']
        
        i = len(ps)-1
        count = 0
        while i>=0:
            if ps[i] == '..':
                count += 1
                del ps[i]
            elif count > 0:
                count -= 1
                del ps[i]
            i -= 1
        
        res = []
        i = len(ps)-1
        while i>=0:
            res.append('/'+ps[i])
            i -= 1
        if not res:
            return '/'
        res.reverse()
        return ''.join(res)
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. nice and tidy, 62ms:
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        stack = []
        for p in path.split("/"):
            if p == "..":
                if stack: stack.pop()
            elif p and p != '.': stack.append(p)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
