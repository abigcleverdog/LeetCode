135. Candy
```
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
```

my thoughts:
```
1. left scan and right scan.
*tricky part in this question is that child rated the same as its neighbors can have just 1 candy (sucker)
```

my solution:

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not ratings:
            return 0
        n = len(ratings)
        candy = [1]*n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candy[i] = candy[i-1] + 1            
                
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candy[i] = max(candy[i+1] + 1, candy[i])            
                
        return sum(candy)
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. just count ascending/descending sequences, 99ms:
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if ratings is None or len(ratings) <= 1:
            return len(ratings)
        
        total = 1
        pre = 1
        countDown = 0
        for i in range(1,len(ratings)):
            if(ratings[i] >= ratings[i-1]):
                if(countDown > 0):
                    total += countDown * (countDown + 1)//2
                    if(countDown >= pre):
                        total += countDown - pre + 1
                    countDown = 0
                    pre = 1
                if(ratings[i] == ratings[i-1]):
                    pre = 1
                else:
                    pre += 1
                total += pre
            else:
                countDown += 1
        if(countDown > 0):
            total += countDown * (countDown + 1)//2
            if(countDown >= pre):
                total += countDown - pre + 1;
        return total
