89. Grey Code
```
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

my thoughts:
```
1. what is the pattern?
0000 -- 0
0001 -- 1

0011 -- 3   1+1
0010 -- 2   1+0

0110 -- 6   1+10
0111 -- 7   1+11
0101 -- 5   1+01
0100 -- 4   1+00

2. grey code formula:
G(i) = i^(i>>1)
