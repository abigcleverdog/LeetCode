236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
```
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

my thoughts:
```
1. find path from root to q and root to p; compare till a deviation is found.

```

my solution:
```

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root:
            return root
        def find(r, n, path):
            if not r:
                return False
            if r is n:
                path.append(r)
                return True
            left = find(r.left, n, path)
            right = find(r.right, n, path)
            if left or right:
                path.append(r)
                return True
            return False
            
        pp, pq = [], []
        find(root, p, pp)
        find(root, q, pq)
        while pp and pq and pp[-1] is pq[-1]:
            res = pp.pop()
            pq.pop()
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. recursion:
public class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null || root == p || root == q)  return root;
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        if(left != null && right != null)   return root;
        return left != null ? left : right;
    }
}

2. iterative:
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
    stack = [root]
    parent = {root: None}
    while p not in parent or q not in parent:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node.left:
            parent[node.left] = node
            stack.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            parent[node.right] = node
            stack.append(node.right)
    ancestors = set()
    while p:
        ancestors.add(p)
        p = parent[p]
    while q not in ancestors:
        q = parent[q]
    return q
