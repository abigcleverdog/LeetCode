72. Edit Distance
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
```

my thoughts:
```
1. typical dp. 1d dp should work and if we set rows <= cols should help the performance.
```

my solution:

from other ppl's solution:

1. maybe this is 0d dp, 172ms:
