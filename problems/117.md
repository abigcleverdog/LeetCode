117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
```
Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
For example,
Given the following binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
```

my thoughts:
```
1. thanks to the .next attribute, each level can be treated as a linked list. Only the head is needed for level order traversal.
```

my solution:
```

# Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
# class TreeLinkNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        if not root:
            return
        root.next = None
        cur = root
        prev = None
        head = None
        while cur:
            while cur:
                if cur.left:
                    if not prev:
                        prev = cur.left
                        head = cur.left
                    else:
                        prev.next = cur.left
                        prev = prev.next
                if cur.right:
                    if not prev:
                        prev = cur.right
                        head = cur.right
                    else:
                        prev.next = cur.right
                        prev = prev.next
                cur = cur.next
            if prev:
                prev.next = None
            else:
                break
            cur = head
            prev = None
