386. Lexicographical Numbers
```
Given an integer n, return 1 - n in lexicographical order.

For example, given 13, return: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

Please optimize your algorithm to use less time and space. The input size may be as large as 5,000,000.

1. dfs.
```

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        def dfs(res, cur, n):
            if cur > n:
                return
            else:
                res.append(cur)
                for i in range(10):
                    if cur * 10 + i > n:
                        return
                    dfs(res, cur * 10 + i, n)
        for i in range(1, 10):
            dfs(res, i, n)
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. The idea is pretty simple. If we look at the order we can find out we just keep adding digit from 0 to 9 to every digit and make it a tree.
Then we visit every node in pre-order. 
       1        2        3    ...
      /\        /\       /\
   10 ...19  20...29  30...39   ....

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=1;i<10;++i){
          dfs(i, n, res); 
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    public void dfs(int cur, int n, List<Integer> res){
        if(cur>n)
            return;
        else{
            res.add(cur);
            for(int i=0;i<10;++i){
                if(10*cur+i>n)
                    return;
                dfs(10*cur+i, n, res);
            }
        }
    }
}

2. Simple. easy to understand. No fking weird, rarely used built-int functions.

class Solution(object):
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        ans = [1]
        while len(ans) < n:
            new = ans[-1] * 10
            while new > n:
                new /= 10
                new += 1
                while new % 10 == 0:    # deal with case like 199+1=200 when we need to restart from 2.
                    new /= 10
            ans.append(new)    
        return ans
		
3. public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(n);
        int curr = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            list.add(curr);
            if (curr * 10 <= n) {
                curr *= 10;
            } else if (curr % 10 != 9 && curr + 1 <= n) {
                curr++;
            } else {
                while ((curr / 10) % 10 == 9) {
                    curr /= 10;
                }
                curr = curr / 10 + 1;
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
The basic idea is to find the next number to add.
Take 45 for example: if the current number is 45, the next one will be 450 (450 == 45 * 10)(if 450 <= n), or 46 (46 == 45 + 1) (if 46 <= n) or 5 (5 == 45 / 10 + 1)(5 is less than 45 so it is for sure less than n).
We should also consider n = 600, and the current number = 499, the next number is 5 because there are all "9"s after “4” in “499” so we should divide 499 by 10 until the last digit is not “9”.
It is like a tree, and we are easy to get a sibling, a left most child and the parent of any node.
