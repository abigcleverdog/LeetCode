19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
```
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. build a gap of n between p1 and p2. when p2 has no next, remove p1.
```

my solution:
```

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        p1 = ListNode(-1)
        p1.next = head
        p2 = p1
        p3 = head
        while n > 0:
            p3 = p3.next
            n -= 1
        
        while p3:
            p2 = p2.next
            p3 = p3.next
            
        p2.next = p2.next.next
        
        return p1.next
```
