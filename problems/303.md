303. Range Sum Query - Immutable
```
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. seems like a object structure design to accelerate certain calls. just need to keep track of the accumulative sum and a substraction will give the sum of subarray.
```


my solution:
```
**********62ms
class NumArray(object):

    def __init__(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        """
        self.nums = nums
        self.sums = [0]
        for n in nums:
            n_sum = n+self.sums[-1]
            self.sums.append(n_sum)

    def sumRange(self, i, j):
        """
        :type i: int
        :type j: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.sums[j+1] - self.sums[i]


# Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = NumArray(nums)
# param_1 = obj.sumRange(i,j)
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. do not need to re-implement nums, 55ms:
class NumArray(object):

    def __init__(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        """
        self.sums = [0]*(len(nums)+1)
        for i in xrange(1,len(nums)+1):
            self.sums[i] = self.sums[i-1]+nums[i-1]
        

    def sumRange(self, i, j):
        """
        :type i: int
        :type j: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.sums[j+1]-self.sums[i]

```
