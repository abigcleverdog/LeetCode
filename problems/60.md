60. Permutation Sequence
```
The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. make an array [1,2,3...n] the kth permutation has to have i(0 based) * ( k/(n-1)! ) precursors, so that the first number can be picked from the array; delete the num from the array and substract i*( k/(n-1)! ) from k, repeat till only one num in the array, put the num at the end of the res.
time: O(n); space: O(n)
```

my solution:
```
**********67 ms
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if k<=0:
            return ""
        def helper(k, res, array, base, i):
            if len(array) == 1:
                res.append(array[0])
                return
            idx = (k-1)//base
            res.append(array[idx])
            helper(k-idx*base, res, array[:idx]+array[idx+1:], base//i, i-1)
        res = []
        array = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]
        base = 1
        i = 1
        while i<n:
            base *= i
            i += 1
        helper(k, res, array, base, n-1)
        return ''.join([str(i) for i in res])
```

my comments:
```


from other ppl's solution:

1. neat, 56ms:
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        li = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]
        res = ''
        m = 1
        for i in range(1, n) :
             m *= i
        for i in range(n, 0, -1) :
            l = (k - 1) // m
            res += str(li[l]) 
            del li[l]
            k -= l * m
            if i > 1 :
                m //= (i-1)
        return res
```
