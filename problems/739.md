739. Daily Temeratures
```
Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. check from back, if a bigger t found in later of the arrary, mark the idx difference

2. use a stack to keep all previously undecided idx, once cur t > prev t, pop the stack till all the previously undecided idx that are lower than cur t are updated. store the calculated idx val in the res arr (default [0,0,0,...,0])
```


my solution:
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. track from back, remember/updated the earliest appearance of a t till cur with a hash table, seach if all bigger t existed, and find the min idx difference:
class Solution(object):
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures):
        """
        :type temperatures: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # Time: O(n.k), where k is the range of the temperature.
        # Space: O(n + k)
        temps = {}
        results = [0] * len(temperatures)
        for i in range(len(temperatures) - 1, -1, -1):
            temp = temperatures[i]
            day = str('inf')
            for j in range(temp + 1, 101):
                if j in temps:
                    day = min(day, temps[j] - i)
            if day != str('inf'):
                results[i] = day
            temps[temp] = i
        return results
```
