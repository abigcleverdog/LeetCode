3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. iterate from left. use a hashset to keep current substring non-repeating. when duplicates are found, update the longest length, pop element from the left till the dup is spit out. keep going.

2. two pointers. right pointer iterate the str, keep a dict{char:position the char was last seen at} when a repeating char is found and if the left pointer is left to the last seen position, move the left pointer to last seen. update the max len while right pointer moving to right.
```

```
