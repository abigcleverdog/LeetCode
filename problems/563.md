563. Binary Tree Tilt
```
Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

Example:
Input: 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
Note:

The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. if n is None, set its value at 0; the recursion calculate the sum till n (l+r+n). at each n, update the sum of tilt
```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def findTilt(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root or (not root.left and not root.right):
            return 0
        self.res = 0
        def tilt(n):
            if not n:
                return 0
            
            l = tilt(n.left)
            r = tilt(n.right)
            diff = abs(l-r)
            self.res = self.res + diff
            
            return l + r + n.val
        tilt(root)
        return self.res
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 82ms run time
more practice on differentiating what a func does and what it returns

from other ppl's solution:

1. N/A
```
