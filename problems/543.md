543. Diameter of Binary Tree
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. traversal the tree and update the longest diameter


```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.d = 0
        
        def dep(n):
            if not n:
                return -1
            else:
                return max(dep(n.left), dep(n.right))+1
            
        def l(n):
            if not n:
                return
            else:
                self.d = max(self.d, dep(n.left)+dep(n.right)+2)
                l(n.left)
                l(n.right)
                
        l(root)
        return self.d
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 1019ms run time

the problem of my solution is the two layers of recursion.

Tried to optimize the code, got a Time Limit Exceeded, so made it worse:
******** see the highlighted line for reason. This is calling the functions for a second time while we just need the value of the funtions. An easy fix is change to `return max(l-1, r-1) +1`
class Solution(object):
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.d = 0
        
        def dep(n):
            if not n:
                return -1
            else:
                l = dep(n.left)+1
                r = dep(n.right)+1
                self.d = max( self.d, l+r )
                
 -----------    return max(dep(n.left), dep(n.right))+1
        dep(root)
        return self.d
		
somehow modifying the code makes it work, 95 ms:
class Solution(object):
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.d = 0
        
        def dia(n):
            if not n:
                return 0
            l = dia(n.left)
            r = dia(n.right)
            self.d = max(self.d, l+r)
            
            return 1+max(l,r)
        dia(root)
        return self.d

from other ppl's solution:

1. seems very subtle difference in coding impact the runtime significantly, I have not figured out why
