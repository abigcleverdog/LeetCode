565. Array Nesting
```
A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.

Example 1:
Input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A[0] = 5, A[1] = 4, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, A[4] = 1, A[5] = 6, A[6] = 2.

One of the longest S[K]:
S[0] = {A[0], A[5], A[6], A[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
Note:
N is an integer within the range [1, 20,000].
The elements of A are all distinct.
Each element of A is an integer within the range [0, N-1].

my thoughts:
```
1. use a checker to avoid recounting
```


my solution:
```
**********96ms
class Solution(object):
    def arrayNesting(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = len(nums)
        checker = [0] * l
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(l):
            if checker[i] == 0:
                ts = set()
                j = i
                while nums[j] not in ts:
                    checker[j] = 1
                    ts.add(nums[j])
                    j = nums[j]
                diff = len(ts)
                res = max(res, diff)
        
        return res
```

my comments:
```

The example was wrong ...

from other ppl's solution:

1. using [False] * n as checker may be faster than [0] * n, 68ms:
class Solution(object):
    def arrayNesting(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        n = len(nums)
        visited = [False] * n
        res = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if visited[i]:
                continue
            visited[i] = True
            cnt = 1
            start = i
            i = nums[i]
            while i != start:
                visited[i] = True
                i = nums[i]
                cnt += 1
            res = max(cnt, res)
        
        return res
```
