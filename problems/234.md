234. Palindrome Linked list
```
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Follow up:
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
```

my thoughts:
```
1. it is easy to do with O(n) space.

2. for O(1) space,
a) find the length of the list,
b) reverse the first half,
c) compare with the second half
```


my solution:
```

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        l = 1
        h = head
        while h.next:
            l += 1
            h = h.next
        h1 = head
        p = None
        i = 0
        while i<l/2:
            n = h1.next
            h1.next = p
            p = h1
            h1 = n
            i += 1
        if l%2 == 0:
            h2 = h1
        else:
            h2 = h1.next
        while p and h2:
            if p.val != h2.val:
                return False
            p = p.next
            h2 = h2.next
        if p or h2:
            return False
        return True
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. two pointers to find the lengh and reverse the first half at the same time, 102ms:
** this is gold:
rev, slow.next, slow = slow, rev, slow.next

class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        """445"""
        rev = None
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            rev, slow.next, slow = slow, rev, slow.next
        if fast:
            slow = slow.next
        while rev and rev.val == slow.val:
            slow = slow.next
            rev = rev.next
        return not rev
```
