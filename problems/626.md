626. Exchange Seats
```
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

my thoughts:
```
1. use a stack and a pointer, **while pointer, put pointer in stack, move pointer to left, if pointer to None, point to stack.pop() and put pointer in res, move pointer to right repeat**

tricky part is the while to left but if to right.
```


my solution:
```
**********40ms
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def inorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        stack = []
        cur = root
        res = []
        while stack or cur:
            while cur:
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left
            cur = stack.pop()
            res.append(cur.val)
            cur = cur.right
                
        return res              
```

my comments:
```

seems the OJ will append any listNode as an array if it is implemented in the array format

from other ppl's solution:

1. use a flag to mark if the left to the node has been visited (0 or 1), if visited, just chech right, 25ms:
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def inorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        stack = [(root, 0)]                     # put root in, when root.left has not been visited
        result = []
        while stack:
            node, flag = stack.pop()            # retrieve the last one seen
            if flag:                            # if this one's left has been visited, put it in res
                result.append(node.val)
                if node.right:                  # if this one has right, submit the .right to be checked next, the .right's left has not been visited
                    stack.append((node.right, 0))
            else:
                stack.append((node, 1))			# if the left of the last one seen has not been visited, let's visit it.
                if node.left:					# the left of the .left has not been visited
                    stack.append((node.left, 0))
        return result
```
