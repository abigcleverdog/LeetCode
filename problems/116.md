116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
```
Given a binary tree

    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).
For example,
Given the following perfect binary tree,
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL
```

my thoughts:
```
1. use the core->peel structure. link each peel. This is not an O(1) space solution.

```


my solution:
```
# Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
# class TreeLinkNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        if not root:
            return root
        core = [root]
        while core:
            peel = []
            for n in core:
                if n.left:
                    peel.append(n.left)
                    peel.append(n.right)
            i = 0
            while i<len(peel)-1:
                peel[i].next = peel[i+1]
                i = i + 1
            core = peel
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 95ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

1. use the n.next.left for n.right.next, 69ms, O(1) space.
eg.
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL
2.next is 3; 3.left is 2.right.next
	
class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree link node
    # @return nothing
    def connect(self, root):
        while root and root.left:
            next = root.left
            while root:
                root.left.next = root.right
                root.right.next = root.next and root.next.left
                root = root.next
            root = next

```
