222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
```
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. recursion.
```

my solution:
```
********** 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        left = self.depth(root.left)
        right = self.depth(root.right)
        
        if left == right:
            return (1<<left) - 1 + 1 + self.countNodes(root.right)
        else:
            return self.countNodes(root.left) + 1 + (1<<right) - 1
        
    def depth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        else:
            return self.depth(root.left) + 1
```
