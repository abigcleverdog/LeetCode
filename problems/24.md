24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
```
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. use a pseudo head, then swap and propogate
```

my solution:
```
**********36ms
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        prev = ListNode(-1)
        prev.next = head
        A = prev
        B = prev.next
        print 'hi'
        
        while B and B.next:
            A.next = B.next
            B.next = B.next.next
            A.next.next = B
            A = B
            B = A.next
            #t = prev
            #temp = []
            #while t.next:
            #    temp.append(t.next.val)
            #    t = t.next
            #print temp
            
        return prev.next
```

my comments:
```

may be a good practice to assign new value to a variable immediately after the var is used when doing a repeating swap to avoid infinite loop.

in my code:
if change 
	A.next = B.next
	B.next = B.next.next
	A.next.next = B
to
	A.next = B.next
	A.next.next = B
	B.next = B.next.next
it is a inifinite loop between B and B.next

from other ppl's solution:

1. N/A
