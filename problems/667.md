667. Beautiful Arrangement II
```
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
Note:
The n and k are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. for n = 7:
k = 1 --  1_2 3 4 5 6 7
k = 2 --  7_1_2 3 4 5 6
k = 3 --  1_7_2_3 4 5 6
k = 4 --  7_1_6_2_3 4 5
k = 5 --  1_7_2_6_3_4 5
k = 6 --  1_7_2_6_3_5_4

```


my solution:
```
**********102ms
class Solution(object):
    def constructArray(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        l = 1
        r = n
        while k>1:
            if k%2 == 0:
                res.append(r)
                r -= 1
            else:
                res.append(l)
                l += 1
            
            k -= 1
        while l<=r:
            res.append(l)
            l += 1
        return res
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. different approach, 82ms:
class Solution(object):
    def constructArray(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = range(1, n-k)
        for i in range(k+1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(n-k + i/2)
            else:
                ans.append(n - i/2)
        return ans
