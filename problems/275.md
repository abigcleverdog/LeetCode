275. H-Index II
```
Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?
```

my thoughts:
```
1. count from the max and increase the counter till the citation is less than the counter.
O(n)
```

my solution:
```
********** 
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        h = 0
        for c in citations[::-1]:
            if c > h:
                h += 1
            else:
                break
        return h
```
