160. intersection of Two Linked Lists
```
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
begin to intersect at node c1.


Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

my thoughts:
```
1. two pointers on each linked list, fast pointer to find the end of the list, then move the slow pointer to line-up the starting node for comparison
```


my solution:
```
**********395ms
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        ha1 = ha2 = headA
        hb1 = hb2 = headB
        while ha1 and hb1:
            ha1 = ha1.next
            hb1 = hb1.next
        if ha1:
            while ha1:
                ha1 = ha1.next
                ha2 = ha2.next
        else:
            while hb1:
                hb1 = hb1.next
                hb2 = hb2.next
        while ha2 and hb2:
            if ha2 == hb2:
                return ha2
            ha2 = ha2.next
            hb2 = hb2.next
        return None
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. stick list A to the end of list B and list B to the end of list A, find the joint, 308ms:
**problem with this is what if there is no joint?? well, after running list A and list B, both pointer will point to None, so return None.
class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        pointer_a, pointer_b = headA, headB
        
        while pointer_a is not pointer_b:
            pointer_a = headB if pointer_a is None else pointer_a.next
            pointer_b = headA if pointer_b is None else pointer_b.next
        return pointer_a
```
