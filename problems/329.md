329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
```
Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:

nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

Example 2:

nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]
Return 4
The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

my thoughts:
```
1. scan the matrix for local maximum, in a dp matrix, mark the max as 1 bfs from max and update each dp element to largest possible val. 
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. looks cleaner and also faster:
We can find longest decreasing path instead, the result will be the same. Use dp to record previous results and choose the max dp value of smaller neighbors.

def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix):
    def dfs(i, j):
        if not dp[i][j]:
            val = matrix[i][j]
            dp[i][j] = 1 + max(
                dfs(i - 1, j) if i and val > matrix[i - 1][j] else 0,
                dfs(i + 1, j) if i < M - 1 and val > matrix[i + 1][j] else 0,
                dfs(i, j - 1) if j and val > matrix[i][j - 1] else 0,
                dfs(i, j + 1) if j < N - 1 and val > matrix[i][j + 1] else 0)
        return dp[i][j]

    if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return 0
    M, N = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * N for i in range(M)]
    return max(dfs(x, y) for x in range(M) for y in range(N))
