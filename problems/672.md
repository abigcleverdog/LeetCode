672. Bulb Switcher II
```
There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.

Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:

Flip all the lights.
Flip lights with even numbers.
Flip lights with odd numbers.
Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
Example 1:
Input: n = 1, m = 1.
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
Example 2:
Input: n = 2, m = 1.
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
Example 3:
Input: n = 3, m = 1.
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
Note: n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. the operations will eventually repeat the result, just write case by case till it hits 8 (the max outcome cout)
```


my solution:
```

class Solution(object):
    def flipLights(self, n, m):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type m: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if m == 0:
            return 1
        if m == 1:
            return n+1 if n+1<4 else 4
        
        if n < 3:
            return 2**n
        
        if m == 2:
            return 7
        
        return 8
```

Read question more carefully. it says 'exactly m operations' so when m = 2, we cannot produce the result of doing button 4 only once.

from other ppl's solution:

1. a solution I do not quite understand yet:
Suppose we did f[0] of the first operation, f[1] of the second, f[2] of the third, and f[3] of the fourth, where sum(f) == m.

First, all these operations commute: doing operation A followed by operation B yields the same result as doing operation B followed by operation A. Also, doing operation A followed by operation A again is the same as doing nothing. So really, we only needed to know the residues cand[i] = f[i] % 2. There are only 16 different possibilities for the residues in total, so we can try them all.

Weâ€™ll loop cand through all 16 possibilities (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1), ..., (1, 1, 1, 1). A necessary and sufficient condition for cand to be valid is that sum(cand) % 2 == m % 2 and sum(cand) <= m, as only when these conditions are satisfied can we find some f with sum(f) == m and cand[i] = f[i] % 2.

Also, as the sequence of lights definitely repeats every 6 lights, we could replace n with min(n, 6). Actually, we could replace it with min(n, 3), as those lights are representative: that is, knowing the first 3 lights is enough to reconstruct what the next 3 lights will be. If the first 3 lights are X, Y, Z, then with a little effort we can prove the next 3 lights will be (X^Y^Z), Z, Y.

def flipLights(self, n, m):
    seen = set()
    for cand in itertools.product((0, 1), repeat = 4):
        if sum(cand) % 2 == m % 2 and sum(cand) <= m:
            A = []
            for i in xrange(min(n, 3)):
                light = 1
                light ^= cand[0]
                light ^= cand[1] and i % 2
                light ^= cand[2] and i % 2 == 0
                light ^= cand[3] and i % 3 == 0
                A.append(light)
            seen.add(tuple(A))

    return len(seen)
