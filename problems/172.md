172. Fractorial Trailing Zeroes
```
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

my thoughts:
```
1. as 10 = 2*5; 2 appears more frequently than 5, so I just count the number of 5's in all the factors.
```


my solution:
```
**********42ms
class Solution(object):
    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        while n>0:
            n = n/5
            res = res+n
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. for some reason, the rescursion is faster, 28ms:
class Solution(object):
    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        else:
            return n // 5 + self.trailingZeroes(n // 5)
```
