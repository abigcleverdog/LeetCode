264. Ugly Number II
```
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number, and n does not exceed 1690.

my thoughts:
```
1. build an arr of 2n, mark or primes from 7 and their multiples, find the index of nth unmarked num.
* 2n is not enough when n is large. as n get large, the ugly number becomes rare.

2. use a heap to keep the min of next candidates.
```

my solution:
```
********** TLE
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n < 1:
            return 0
        
        i = 0
        h = [1]
        while i < n:
            res = heapq.heappop(h)
            for j in (2, 3, 5):
                if j * res not in set(h):
                    heapq.heappush(h, j * res)
            i += 1
            
        return res
		
## Last executed input:	1185

        if n < 1:
            return 0
        
        arr = [0] * n
        arr[0] = 1
        two = three = five = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            arr[i] = min(arr[two] * 2, arr[three] * 3, arr[five] * 5)
            if arr[i] == arr[two] * 2:
                two += 1
            if arr[i] == arr[three] * 3:
                three += 1
            if arr[i] == arr[five] * 5:
                five += 1
        return arr[-1]
