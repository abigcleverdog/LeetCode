188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

from other ppl's solution:

1. I think the general idea has been thoroughly explained by other brilliant leetcoders. All of the solutions are beautiful and concise. However, most of the them don’t look obvious to me, so I wrote this and hope it looks more straight forward.
It’s O(kn), apparently not optimal. I name the key variables as local profit and global profit to make things much understandable (well, at least , to me). Performance is not too bad though.
def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    n = len(prices)
    if k >= n // 2:
        return sum(
            x - y
            for x, y in zip(prices[1:], prices[:-1])
            if x > y)
    
    profits = [0] * n
    for j in range(k):
        # Update new_profits
        max_all = max_prev = max_here = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            profit = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
            max_here = max(max_here + profit, max_prev + profit, max_prev)
            max_prev = profits[i]
            profits[i] = max_all = max(max_all, max_here)
    return profits[-1]
