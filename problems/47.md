47. Permutations II
```
Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

For example,
[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

my thoughts:
```
1. dfs. sort nums so the repeating numbers are adjacent, at each depth, skip repeating numbers.
```

my solution:
```

class Solution:
    def permuteUnique(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        res = []
        cur = []
        nums.sort()
        self.helper(nums, res, cur)
        return res
    
    def helper(self, nums, res, cur):
        if not nums:
            res.append(cur[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i != 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            cur.append(nums[i])
            self.helper(nums[:i]+nums[i+1:], res, cur)
            cur.pop()
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. a little hard to understand from the code but more intuitive mathmatically. pick the first n1 (any from nums), it has only one position to go, now we have [n1]; pick a n2 (any from rest), it has two positions can go, now we have [n1, n2] and [n2, n1]; pick n3, three positons can go for each of previous result, now we have [n1,n2,n3], [n1,n3,n2], [n3,n1,n2] + [n2,n1,n3], [n2,n3,n1], [n3,n2,n1]... , 103ms:
class Solution(object):
    def permuteUnique(self, nums):
        perms =[[]]
        for elem in nums:
            smaller_perms = []
            for perm in perms:
                for i in range(len(perm) + 1):
                    smaller_perms.append(perm[:i] + [elem] + perm[i:])
                    if i < len(perm) and perm[i] == elem:
                        break
            perms = smaller_perms
        return perms
