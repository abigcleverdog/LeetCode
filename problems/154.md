154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
```
Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

my thoughts:
```
1. binary search won't work for worst senario.
    111111111110111  or  11101111111111111
```

my solution:
```
**********44ms
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            if nums[l] == nums[r]:
                r -= 1
            elif nums[l] < nums[r]:
                return nums[l]
            else:
                mid = (l+r) // 2
                if nums[mid] < nums[l]:
                    r = mid
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
        return nums[l]
```
