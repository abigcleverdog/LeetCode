86. Partition List
```
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

For example,
Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
return 1->2->2->4->3->5.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. two dummy nodes. one for <= and one for >= (when a == is found, move on so that it stays in original order)

2. 1 is wrong, == should go with >. as it should not stay with the < to break the order. [1,4,2,3,4,5,6,7] 4. we cannot put 4 after 1.
the code is actually easier: two dummy nodes, 5 pointers (each dummy has two for head and tail, the last one is iterating the list)
```

my solution:
```

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head, x):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type x: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head: # not x will be true, if x == 0 ...
            return head
        dummyS = Stail = ListNode(0)
        dummyL = Ltail = ListNode(1)
        p1 = head
        while p1:
            if p1.val < x:
                Stail.next = p1
                Stail = Stail.next
            else:
                Ltail.next = p1
                Ltail = Ltail.next
            p1 = p1.next
        Ltail.next = None ## otherwise it may point back!!!
        Stail.next = dummyL.next
        return dummyS.next
```

my comments:
```

not x is true when x == 0;
be careful with the tail of a linkedlist

from other ppl's solution:

1. N/A
