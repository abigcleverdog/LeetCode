645. Set Mismatch
```
The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
Note:
The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
The given array's numbers won't have any order.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. sort the arr,
iterate and find the dup and the missing
time: O(nlgn) + O(n) = O(nlgn)
space: O(1)

2. build a helper_arr [1]*n,
iterate the arr, for num in arr, h_arr[num] -=1;
iterate the h_arr, if n < 0, index is dup, if n>0, index is missing
return [dup, missing]
time: O(n) + O(n) +c = O(n)
space: O(n)


```


my solution:
```
**********79ms
class Solution(object):
    def findErrorNums(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        h_arr = [1]*len(nums)
        res = [0,0]
        for n in nums:
            h_arr[n-1] -= 1
        for i,n in enumerate(h_arr):
            if n<0: res[0] = i+1
            if n>0: res[1] = i+1
        return res
```

my comments:
```
think deeper
converting arr to set is relative cheap
from other ppl's solution:

1. do the match, 49 ms:
class Solution(object):
    def findErrorNums(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # a little math
        nums_sum = (len(nums) + 1) * len(nums) // 2
        no_repeat_sum = sum(set(nums))
        miss = nums_sum - no_repeat_sum
        repeat = sum(nums) - no_repeat_sum
        return repeat, miss
```
