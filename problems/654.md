654. Maximum Binary Tree
```
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

The root is the maximum number in the array.
The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.
Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
        1
Note:
The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. find the max for root.val, cut the array into left and right, root.left is the same call on the left, root.right is the same call on the right.
```


my solution:
```

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not nums:
            return
        if len(nums) == 1:
            t = TreeNode(nums[0])
            return t
        idx = 0
        i = 0
        m = nums[0]
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i]>m:
                m = nums[i]
                idx = i
            i += 1
        t = TreeNode(m)
        t.left = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[:idx])
        if idx == len(nums) - 1:
            t.right = None
        else:
            t.right = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[idx+1:])
        return t
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. the neighbours must be a pair of parent/child, use a stack to through out all the paired nodes, 152ms:
class Solution(object):
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            curr = TreeNode(nums[i])
            while stack and stack[-1].val < nums[i]:
                curr.left = stack.pop()
            if stack:
                stack[-1].right = curr
            stack.append(curr)
        return stack[0]
