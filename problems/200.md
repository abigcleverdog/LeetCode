200. Number of Islands
```
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

11110
11010
11000
00000
Answer: 1

Example 2:

11000
11000
00100
00011
Answer: 3

my thoughts:
```
1. BSF.
for some reason, TLE; may be the storage.
2. DFS.
```

my solution:
```
**********
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not grid:
            return 0
        def dfs(grid, i, j, w, h):
            if 0>i or i>=h or 0>j or j>=w or grid[i][j] == '0':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '0'
            dfs(grid, i-1, j, w, h)
            dfs(grid, i+1, j, w, h)
            dfs(grid, i, j-1, w, h)
            dfs(grid, i, j+1, w, h)
        res = 0
        w, h = len(grid[0]), len(grid)
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    res += 1
                    dfs(grid, i, j, w, h)
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. map:
def numIslands(self, grid):
    def sink(i, j):
        if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[i]) and grid[i][j] == '1':
            grid[i][j] = '0'
            map(sink, (i+1, i-1, i, i), (j, j, j+1, j-1))
            return 1
        return 0
    return sum(sink(i, j) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[i])))
	
2.For any problem I work on, I will try to generalize some reusable template out for future use. We have limited time during interview and too much to worry about, so having some code template to use is very handy. For this problem, although it is easier and probably suggested to use BFS, but Union find also comes handy and can be easily extended to solve Island 2 and Surrounded regions.

I separate all the union find logic in a separate class and use 1d version to make the code clear. I also use a 2d array for the 4 direction visit. int[][] distance = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};

    int[][] distance = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {  
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0)  {
            return 0;  
        }
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(grid);  
        int rows = grid.length;  
        int cols = grid[0].length;  
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {  
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {  
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {  
                    for (int[] d : distance) {
                        int x = i + d[0];
                        int y = j + d[1];
                        if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols && grid[x][y] == '1') {  
                            int id1 = i*cols+j;
                            int id2 = x*cols+y;
                            uf.union(id1, id2);  
                        }  
                    }  
                }  
            }  
        }  
        return uf.count;  
    }
Union Find:

    class UnionFind {
        int[] father;  
        int m, n;
        int count = 0;
        UnionFind(char[][] grid) {  
            m = grid.length;  
            n = grid[0].length;  
            father = new int[m*n];  
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {  
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {  
                    if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                        int id = i * n + j;
                        father[id] = id;
                        count++;
                    }
                }  
            }  
        }
        public void union(int node1, int node2) {  
            int find1 = find(node1);
            int find2 = find(node2);
            if(find1 != find2) {
                father[find1] = find2;
                count--;
            }
        }
        public int find (int node) {  
            if (father[node] == node) {  
                return node;
            }
            father[node] = find(father[node]);  
            return father[node];
        }
    }
