437. Path Sum III
```
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

my thoughts:
```
1. from root to leaves, use a set to keep track of all next hit.
say level -1, set={8}, if level 0 (root.val) is 8, counter+1
till no leaves
* should be an array instead of set, as duplicates are possible, eg. 8  8->0   8->0->0 ...
2. func pathSum(root, sum) = pathSum(root.left, sum-root.val) + pathSum(root.right, sum-root.val)

base case:
root is None, return 0
if root.val == sum, return 1 + left + right
** bad idea, this is assuming the path go through root for sure
```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    
    def pathSum(self, root, sum):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type sum: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        ss = [sum]
        #count = 0
        self.count = 0
        
        def pa(n, ss):
#            print ss
#            print n.val if n else "none"
#            if n:
#                print n.left.val if n.left else "none", n.right.val if n.right else "none"
                    
            if not n:
                return
            
            i=0
            while i<len(ss):
                ss[i] = ss[i] - n.val
                if ss[i] == 0:
                    self.count = self.count + 1
#                    print self.count
                    
                i = i+1
            ss.append(sum)
            ssr = []
            ssr.extend(ss)
            pa(n.left, ss)
            pa(n.right, ssr)
            
            
        pa(root, ss)
        return self.count
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 772ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

1. 12/13/2017, talked to Dahai, this is a presum type question, the run time for my solution is O(n^2), worst case (linear chain), and O(nlgn), best case (balanced tree). the hold back is the array, if I change it to a dict, then it will be O(n). revised solution:

TBA
