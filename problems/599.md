599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
```
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
Note:
The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
No duplicates in both lists.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. a) iterate array1. build a {str : ind} dict1 ->
b) iterate array2, if str in dict1, build a {str: ind_sum} dict2 ->
c) return all strs in dict2 with min ind_sum
```


my solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        """
        :type list1: List[str]
        :type list2: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        d1, d2 = {}, {}
        for i, e in enumerate(list1):
            d1[e] = i
        for i, e in enumerate(list2):
            if e in d1:
                d2[e] = i + d1[e]
        r = min(d2.values())
        res = []
        for e in d2:
            if d2[e] == r:
                res.append(e)
        return res
                
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 109ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

to build the {str: ind} dict:
 d1 = {val:ind for ind,val in enumerate(list1)}

1. combine b) and c), 88 ms:
	
class Solution(object):
    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        """
        :type list1: List[str]
        :type list2: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        exist = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(list1)}
        tmp = 2**32 - 1
        ans = []
        
        for i, x in enumerate(list2):
            if x in exist:
                if i + exist[x] < tmp:
                    tmp = i + exist[x]
                    ans = [x]
                elif i + exist[x] == tmp:
                    ans.append(x)
                
        return ans
```
