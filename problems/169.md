169. Majority Element
```
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

```
my thoughts:
1. frequency count for all e in arr ->
   return the most frequent e.
   O(n+lg(m)) m is the number of unique e's.
2. 'the majority e appears more than n/2'
   so that if the arr is sorted, the mid
   will be the majority e.
   O(n*lg(n))
3. compare the neighbours arr[i] and arr[i+1] ->
     if they are the same, keep arr[i], discard arr[i+1] ->
     else discard both ->
	 
   Seems a deadend, cannot deal with odd length

my solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = len(nums)
        if l == 0:
            return
        
        dict = {}
        
        for n in nums:
            dict[n] = dict[n] + 1 if n in dict else 1
            
        for n in dict:
            if dict[n]>l/2:
                return n
```

my comments:
solution accepted, 59ms run time
from other ppl's solution:
1. as majority e appears more than n/2 times, the longest
repeating e's must be maj e; so we can put a counter to
track the longest repeating e.
This is also called Boyer-Moore voting algorithm. The voting
analogy is quite insightful. if I want to win over 50% in
a vote, my votes have to be able to hold against all other
votes (count-1)

2. my second strategy wasn't optimized in run time but
can lead to a simple one line coding:
`return sorted(num)[len(num)/2]`
3. random picking from the arr, this won't improve the
worst case run time, but should improve the average.
4. l-m-r recursion till l=m. 
5. I cannot understand the Bit Manipulation solution...
