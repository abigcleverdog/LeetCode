201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
```
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

For example, given the range [5, 7], you should return 4.

my thoughts:
```
1. 2**i is a bar, 100000... if m and i are on different sides of a 2**i, return 0. otherwise check from most significant bit to least significant bit till a difference is found.
```

my solution:
```
**********
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if m == 0:
            return 0
        i = 0
        while 1<<i <= m:
            i += 1
        if 1<<i <= n:
            return 0
        res = 0
        i -= 1
        while i>-1:
            if 1<<i & m == 1<<i & n:
                res |= 1<<i & m
                i -= 1                
            else:
                break
        return res
```
