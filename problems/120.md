120. Triangle
```
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. classic dp. to achieve O(n) space, use 1d dp.
```

my solution:
```

    def minimumTotal(self, triangle):
        """
        :type triangle: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int

        l = len(triangle)
        res = triangle[-1]
        for i in range(l-2, -1, -1):
            #print(res)
            for j in range(i+1):
                res[j] = triangle[i][j] + min(res[j], res[j+1])
        return res[0]
```
