134. Gas Station
```
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. find leftover on each station. it has to start at a positive station and run n steps without draining the tank.
```

my solution:

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. one pass:
def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
    """
    :type gas: List[int]
    :type cost: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    """
    if len(gas) == 0 or len(cost) == 0 or sum(gas) < sum(cost):
        return -1
    position = 0
    balance = 0 # current tank balance
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        balance += gas[i] - cost[i] # update balance
        if balance < 0: # balance drops to negative, reset the start position
            balance = 0
            position = i+1
    return position
```
