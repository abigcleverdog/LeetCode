128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
```
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

1. copied other people's idea.

my solution:
```
**********
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        d = {}
        maxlen = 1
        for n in nums:
            if n in d:
                continue
            else:
                left = d.get(n-1, 0)
                right = d.get(n+1, 0)
                length = 1 + left + right
                if length > maxlen:
                    maxlen = length
                d[n] = 1
                d[n-left] = length
                d[n+right] = length
        return maxlen
