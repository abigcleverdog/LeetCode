11. Container With Most Water
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. two pointers, move the shorter side till it becomes longer or pass the other pointer. update area when new boarders are found.
```

        int start = 0, end = height.length - 1, res = 0;
        while (start < end) {
            int area = (end - start) * Math.min(height[start], height[end]);
            res = Math.max(res, area);
            if (height[start] < height[end]) {
                int temp = height[start];
                while (start < end && height[start] <= temp) start++;
            } else {
                int temp = height[end];
                while (start < end && height[end] <= temp) end--;
            }
        }
