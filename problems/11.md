11. Container With Most Water
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. two pointers, move the shorter side till it becomes longer or pass the other pointer. update area when new boarders are found.
```

class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """        
        l = 0
        r = len(height)-1
        area = (r-l)*min(height[l], height[r])
        while l<r:
            if height[l]<height[r]:
                i = 1
                while l+i < r and height[l+i] <= height[l]:
                    i += 1
                l += i
            else:
                i = 1
                while l < r-i and height[r-i] <= height[r]:
                    i += 1
                r -= i
            new_area = (r-l)*min(height[l], height[r])
            area = max(new_area, area)    
        return area
