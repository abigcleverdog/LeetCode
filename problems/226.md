Invert a binary tree.

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. iteration:
inorder stack
while stack, swap n.left and n.right

2. recursion:
swap left and right, while child
```


my solution:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        
        if not root:
            return root
        left = self.invertTree(root.left)
        right = self.invertTree(root.right)
        left, right = right, left
        root.left = left
        root.right = right
        return root
```

solution accepted, 36ms run time

from other ppl's solution:

1. very pretty iteration:

class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if node:
                node.left,node.right = node.right,node.left
                stack.extend([node.left,node.right])
        return root
```
