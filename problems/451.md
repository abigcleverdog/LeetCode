451. Sort Characters By Frequency
```
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. conver the str to a {char: count} dict, sort dict.values.
```


my solution:
```
**********71ms
class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        d = {}
        for c in s:
            if c in d:
                d[c] += 1
            else:
                d[c] = 1
        temp = sorted(d.items(), key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        res = []
        for k,v in temp:
            res.append(k*v)
        return ''.join(res)
```

my comments:
```
sorted_items = sorted(items, key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True)


from other ppl's solution:

1. same idea, neat implementation, 39ms:
class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        count = {c: s.count(c) for c in set(s)}
        charByFreq = [(key, value) for key, value in count.items()]
        charByFreq.sort(key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True)
        res = [char*freq for char,freq in charByFreq]
        return ''.join(res)
```
