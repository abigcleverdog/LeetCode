442. Find All Duplicates in an Arragy
```
Given an array of integers, 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```

my thoughts:
```
1. use the idx to represent 1-n, use the sign to keep track if certain idx has been visited. if it is, put the idx+1 into the res
```


my solution:
```
**********315ms
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        for n in nums:
            i = n-1 if n>0 else -n-1
            if nums[i]>0:
                nums[i] = -nums[i]
            else:
                res.append(i+1)
        return res
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. Many cheated using a dict ...
