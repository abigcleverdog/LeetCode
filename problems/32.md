32. Longest Valid Parentheses
```
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.

Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. iterate from left count how many '(' can be paired. when a ')' is paired with previous '(' count--, current valid length += 2; when count == 0 (or previously 1, and hit on a ')'), update the valid length with current length, as is is all validated; when previous count == 0 and now we hit a ')', reinitiate current valid length = 0; this way only complete substrings are counted, to find the valid substrings in the incomplete set, iterate from the right.
```

my solution:
```

        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                cnt += 1
            else:
                if cnt > 1:
                    cnt -= 1
                    cur += 2

from other ppl's solution:

1. mark all idx where the char cannot be paired, then the gap between neighbours is the length of a valid substring, 59ms:
class Solution(object):
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = [-1]
        res = 0
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c == '(':
                stack += [i]
            else:
                stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    stack += [i]
                else:
                    res = max(res, i - stack[-1])
        return res
```
