123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

1. dp.

my solution:
```
**********TLE
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        dp[1][j] = max profit with one trans
        dp[2][j] = max profit with sec trans
                       
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(prices)
        if not prices or n < 2:
            return 0
        
        dp = [[0] * (n) for i in range(3)]
        
        for i in range(1, 3):
            for j in range(1, n):
                temp = 0
                for k in range(j):
                    temp = max(temp, prices[j] - prices[k] + dp[i-1][k])
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], temp)
        return dp[-1][-1]
