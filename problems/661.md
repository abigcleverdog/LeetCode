661. Image Smoother
```
Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image, you need to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself. If a cell has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.

Example 1:
Input:
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
Output:
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
Explanation:
For the point (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0
For the point (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0
For the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0
Note:
The value in the given matrix is in the range of [0, 255].
The length and width of the given matrix are in the range of [1, 150].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. seems straightforward. a lot of arr manipulation though.
```


my solution:
```
from copy import deepcopy as copy
class Solution(object):
    def imageSmoother(self, M):
        """
        :type M: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        d = len(M)
        w = len(M[0])
        res = copy(M)
        
        for i in range(d):
            for j in range(w):
                neighbours = [
                    M[x][y]
                    for x in (i-1, i, i+1)
                    for y in (j-1, j, j+1)
                    if 0<=x<d and 0<=y<w
                ]
                res[i][j] = sum(neighbours)//len(neighbours)
                
        return res
```

my comments:
```
solution accepted, 856ms run time
learned the deepcopy method,
tricky part is that when I try to construct a [[]] with the same size as M, the new list of list has some wierd links that when I change new_arr[0][0], it changes all new_arr[i][0]
need to be more familiar with python 2d arr operations

from other ppl's solution:

construct a [[]] with same size:
N = [[0 for _ in range(nCol)] for _ in range(nRow)]

to build the {str: ind} dict:
 d1 = {val:ind for ind,val in enumerate(list1)}
