395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
```
Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```

```
1. recursion

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(s) < k:
            return 0
        d = {}
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in d:
                d[c] = [i]
            else:
                d[c].append(i)
        islands = []
        for c in d:
            if len(d[c]) < k:
                islands.extend(d[c])
        if not islands:
            return len(s)
        else:
            islands.sort()
            islands = [-1] + islands + [len(s)]
            res = i = 0
            while i < len(islands) - 1:
                res = max(res, self.longestSubstring(s[islands[i] + 1: islands[i + 1]], k))
                i += 1
            return res
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. As pointed out by @hayleyhu, I can just take the first too rare character instead of a rarest. Submitted once, accepted in 48 ms.

def longestSubstring(self, s, k):
    for c in set(s):
        if s.count(c) < k:
            return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
    return len(s)
Original:
def longestSubstring(self, s, k):
    if len(s) < k:
        return 0
    c = min(set(s), key=s.count)
    if s.count(c) >= k:
        return len(s)
    return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
If every character appears at least k times, the whole string is ok. Otherwise split by a least frequent character (because it will always be too infrequent and thus canâ€™t be part of any ok substring) and make the most out of the splits.

As usual for Python here, the runtime varies a lot, this got accepted in times from 32 ms to 74 ms.

2. For each h, apply two pointer technique to find the longest substring with at least K repeating characters and the number of unique characters in substring is h.

public class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        int h, i, j, idx, max = 0, unique, noLessThanK;
        
        for (h = 1; h <= 26; h++) {
            Arrays.fill(counts, 0);
            i = 0; 
            j = 0;
            unique = 0;
            noLessThanK = 0;
            while (j < str.length) {
                if (unique <= h) {
                    idx = str[j] - 'a';
                    if (counts[idx] == 0)
                        unique++;
                    counts[idx]++;
                    if (counts[idx] == k)
                        noLessThanK++;
                    j++;
                }
                else {
                    idx = str[i] - 'a';
                    if (counts[idx] == k)
                        noLessThanK--;
                    counts[idx]--;
                    if (counts[idx] == 0)
                        unique--;
                    i++;
                }
                if (unique == h && unique == noLessThanK)
                    max = Math.max(j - i, max);
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
