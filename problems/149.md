149. Max Points on a Line
```
Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. find the line funcs, and count points on each line.
y = a*x + b this will cause two float nums and b is calculated baseed on a. python does not handle it very well. 

2. iterate the points, pin down the first point and scan the later ones for slope (edge cases: same point, same x coord) update the max points on a line as we move first point. still python does not handle the float point num very well. specifically:
[[0,0],[94911151,94911150],[94911152,94911151]] will be regarded as on the same line.

* form other ppl's solution:
import numpy as np;  times the float num by np.longdouble(1) to increase accuracy.
```

my solution:
```
