331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree
```
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.

     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #
For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".

Example 1:
"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Return true

Example 2:
"1,#"
Return false

Example 3:
"9,#,#,1"
Return false

my thoughts:
```
1. scan the string array, use two stacks to keep track of nodes that haven't found a left child, and the nodes that haven't found a right child. if all nodes have l and r, there should not be any new nodes come in, if we finish the nodes all nodes should have both l and r.
```

my solution:
```

class Solution:
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder):
        """
        :type preorder: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if preorder == '#':
            return True
        pre = preorder.split(',')
        l = len(pre)
        i = 1
        
        to_valid = [pre[0]] if pre[0] != '#' else []
        val_left = []
        
        while i < l:
            if not to_valid and not val_left:
                return False
                
            if pre[i] == '#':
                if to_valid:
                    val_left.append(to_valid.pop())
                else:
                    val_left.pop()
            else:
                if to_valid:
                    val_left.append(to_valid.pop())
                elif val_left:
                    val_left.pop()
                to_valid.append(pre[i])
            i += 1
            #print(to_valid, val_left, pre[i - 1])
        return not to_valid and not val_left
```

my comments:

from other ppl's solution:

1. We just need to remember how many empty slots we have during the process.

Initially we have one ( for the root ).

for each node we check if we still have empty slots to put it in.

a null node occupies one slot.
a non-null node occupies one slot before he creates two more. the net gain is one.
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder):
        """
        :type preorder: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # remember how many empty slots we have
        # non-null nodes occupy one slot but create two new slots
        # null nodes occupy one slot
        
        p = preorder.split(',')
        
        #initially we have one empty slot to put the root in it
        slot = 1
        for node in p:
            
            # no empty slot to put the current node
            if slot == 0:
                return False
                
            # a null node?
            if node == '#':
                # ocuppy slot
                slot -= 1
            else:
                # create new slot
                slot += 1
        
        #we don't allow empty slots at the end
        return slot==0
Explanation

Let miss be the smallest sum in [0,n] that we might be missing. Meaning we already know we can build all sums in [0,miss). Then if we have a number num <= miss in the given array, we can add it to those smaller sums to build all sums in [0,miss+num). If we don’t, then we must add such a number to the array, and it’s best to add miss itself, to maximize the reach.

Example: Let’s say the input is nums = [1, 2, 4, 13, 43] and n = 100. We need to ensure that all sums in the range [1,100] are possible.

Using the given numbers 1, 2 and 4, we can already build all sums from 0 to 7, i.e., the range [0,8). But we can’t build the sum 8, and the next given number (13) is too large. So we insert 8 into the array. Then we can build all sums in [0,16).

Do we need to insert 16 into the array? No! We can already build the sum 3, and adding the given 13 gives us sum 16. We can also add the 13 to the other sums, extending our range to [0,29).

And so on. The given 43 is too large to help with sum 29, so we must insert 29 into our array. This extends our range to [0,58). But then the 43 becomes useful and expands our range to [0,101). At which point we’re done.

Another implementation, though I prefer the above one.

int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
    int count = 0, i = 0;
    for (long miss=1; miss <= n; count++)
        miss += (i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) ? nums[i++] : miss;
    return count - i;
}
