45. Jump Game II
```
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

For example:
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

Note:
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. dp. iterate the array, update min jump to i.
eg. :     2,  3,  1,  1,  4
		  -1, -1, -1, -1, -1
check 2:  0,  1,  1,  -1, -1
check 3:  0,  1,  1,  2,  2
stop	  

time: O(n)
space: O(n)
TLE when test with large numbers.

2. keep track of the farthest jump distant with each additional jump, when we can reach len-1, stop, return cur jumps.
eg. :     2,  3,  1,  1,  4, 1, 0, 6
l = 8
jump: 1,	idx = 0,   farthest: 2
jump: 2,	idx = 1-2,   farthest: max(4, 3)
jump: 3,    idx = 2-4,   farthest: max(3, 4, 8)
stop	
There are overlaps ...

3. let's say this is a two pointers. p1 is where we start, p2 is the next stop pointer, at first, this is nums[p1]. scan from p1 to p2 (all possible landing point in this jump), if from any point we can jump further than p2, update the farthest point we can get to in next jump; if we can finish the array, return next jump. set p1 at p2 and p2 at the farthest point. repeat.
time: O(n)
space: O(1)
```

my solution:
```
**********96 ms
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums or len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        l = len(nums)
        p1 = 0
        p2 = nums[0]
        jump = 1
        while p2<l-1:
            jump += 1
            t = p2
            for i in range(p1+1, p2+1):
                if t >= l-1:
                    break
                if (i + nums[i]) > t:
                    t = i + nums[i]
                
            p1 = p2
            p2 = t
        return jump
```

```

from other ppl's solution:

1. bueatiful, love it, 69ms:
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        jumps = cur_end = cur_farthest = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            cur_farthest = max(cur_farthest, i + nums[i])
            if i == cur_end:
                jumps += 1
                cur_end = cur_farthest
        return jumps
