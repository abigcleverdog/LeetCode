434. Number of Segments in a String
```
Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example:

Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
```

my thoughts:
```
1. find the first non ' ' char, if cannot find, return 0
from the first non ' ', iterate through the string,
if a char is found before a break (' '), ignore it and move on,
if a break (' ') is found, mark that and move on,
if a char is found after a break, res + 1.
```


my solution:
```
**********32ms
class Solution(object):
    def countSegments(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        i = 0
        length = len(s)
        while i < length and s[i] ==' ':
            i += 1
        if i == length:
            return 0
        res = 1
        i += 1
        count = False
        while i<length:
            if s[i] != ' ' and count:
                res += 1
                count = False
            if s[i] == ' ':
                count = True
            i += 1
        return res
```

my comments:
```
do not forget there is a built-in function
from other ppl's solution:

1. using built-in func, 22ms:
class Solution(object):
    def countSegments(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return len(s.split())
```
