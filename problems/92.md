92. Reverse Linked List II
```
Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in-place and in one-pass.

For example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4,

return 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.

Note:
Given m, n satisfy the following condition:
1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. N/A
```

my solution:
```
**********66 ms
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head or m == n:
            return head
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        firstTail = dummy
        n -= m
        while m>1:
            firstTail = firstTail.next
            m -= 1
        p1 = firstTail.next
        while n>0:
            temp = p1
            p1 = p1.next
            temp.next = temp.next.next
            p1.next = firstTail.next
            firstTail.next = p1
            p1 = temp
            n -= 1
        return dummy.next
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. it seems easier to figure out the logic when we just reverse a list with no prev or post nodes, 58ms:
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        preHead = dummy
        
        # 先找到 m-th
        for i in range(m - 1):
            preHead = preHead.next    
        mth = preHead.next
        
        # reverse m-n
        prev = None
        curr = mth
        next = None
        for i in range(n - m + 1):
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
        tailNext = curr
        nth = prev
        
        # 连接
        preHead.next = nth
        mth.next = tailNext
        
        return dummy.next
```
