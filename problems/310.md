310. Minimum Height Trees
```
For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1:

Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3
return [1]

Example 2:

Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5
return [3, 4]

Note:

(1) According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”

(2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

my thoughts:
```
1. in edges, find all nodes that just has one edge, these are the leaf nodes, delete them from the nodes pool, delete all edges containing any leaf from edges pool; repeat if there are still candidates, otherwise return prev nodes.
```

2. I am sharing two of my solutions, one is based on the longest path, and the other is related to Tree DP.

Longest Path

It is easy to see that the root of an MHT has to be the middle point (or two middle points) of the longest path of the tree.
Though multiple longest paths can appear in an unrooted tree, they must share the same middle point(s).

Computing the longest path of a unrooted tree can be done, in O(n) time, by tree dp, or simply 2 tree traversals (dfs or bfs).
The following is some thought of the latter.

Randomly select a node x as the root, do a dfs/bfs to find the node y that has the longest distance from x.
Then y must be one of the endpoints on some longest path.
Let y the new root, and do another dfs/bfs. Find the node z that has the longest distance from y.

Now, the path from y to z is the longest one, and thus its middle point(s) is the answer. Java Solution

Tree DP

Alternatively, one can solve this problem directly by tree dp.
Let dp[i] be the height of the tree when the tree root is i.
We compute dp[0] … dp[n - 1] by tree dp in a dfs manner.

Arbitrarily pick a node, say node 0, as the root, and do a dfs.
When we reach a node u, and let T be the subtree by removing all u’s descendant (see the right figure below).
We maintain a variable acc that keeps track of the length of the longest path in T with one endpoint being u.
Then dp[u] = max(height[u], acc)
Note, acc is 0 for the root of the tree.

             |                 |
             .                 .
            /|\               /|\
           * u *             * u *
            /|\
           / | \
          *  v  *
. denotes a single node, and * denotes a subtree (possibly empty).

Now it remains to calculate the new acc for any of u’s child, v.
It is easy to see that the new acc is the max of the following

acc + 1 — extend the previous path by edge uv;

max(height[v’] + 2), where v != v’ — see below for an example.

         u
        /|
       / |
      v' v
      |
      .
      .
      .
      |
      .
In fact, the second case can be computed in O(1) time instead of spending a time proportional to the degree of u.
Otherwise, the runtime can be quadratic when the degree of some node is Omega(n).
The trick here is to maintain two heights of each node, the largest height (the conventional height), and the second largest height
(the height of the node after removing the branch w.r.t. the largest height).

Therefore, after the dfs, all dp[i]'s are computed, and the problem can be answered trivially.
The total runtime is still O(n). Java Solution
