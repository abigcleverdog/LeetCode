535. Encode and Decode TinyURL
```
Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

my thoughts:
```
1. totally cheated
```


my solution:
```
**********56ms
class Codec:
    alp = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
    def __init__(self):
        self.l = {}
        self.s = {}        

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        
        :type longUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        if longUrl in self.l:
            return self.l[longUrl]        
        code = ''.join(random.choice(self.alp) for _ in range(6))
        while code in self.s:
            code = ''.join(random.choice(self.alp) for _ in range(6))
        self.s[code] = longUrl
        self.l[longUrl] = code
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + code

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        
        :type shortUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        return self.s[shortUrl[-6:]]

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. how to get the alphnums:
codes = string.ascii_letters + string.digits # 62 codes
```
