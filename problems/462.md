462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
```
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```

my thoughts:
```
1. sort the array, set l, r pointers, if move l is less expensive, move l, else move r, till l = r. This somehow get a wrong answer.

2. sort the array, set l, r, to meet l and r, a total nums[r]-nums[l] steps are needed. move pointers till cross.
```


my solution:
```
**********65ms
class Solution(object):
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(nums)-1
        res = 0
        nums.sort()
        while l<r:
            res += nums[r] - nums[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return res
```
