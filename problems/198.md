198. House Robber
```
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

my thoughts:
```
1. looks similar to problem 53. Maximum Subarray.
use a modified 1d dp:
for i, n in nums: the cur_max is the max of (cur_max of i-1, cur_max of i-2 + n); the global max is the max cur_max

```


my solution:
```
**********29ms
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0
        if len(nums) == 1: return nums[0]
        if len(nums) == 2: return max(nums)
        p1 = nums[0]
        p2 = max(nums[0],nums[1])
        gmax = p2
        
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if i<2: continue
            cur = max(p1+n, p2)
            if cur>gmax: gmax = cur
            p1 = p2
            p2 = cur
        return gmax
```

my comments:
```
kind of like if get what should be done today(current point) done today, you do not have to worry about not getting the best in the future
from other ppl's solution:

1. the pre max is not going to decrease in this case, so we just need the last p2, 25 ms:
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        '''
        f(0) = nums[0]
        f(1) = max(num[0], num[1])
        f(k+1) = max( f(k-1) + nums[k+1], f(k) )
        '''
        last, now = 0, 0
        
        for num in nums:
            last, now = now, max(last + num, now)
            
        return now
```
