347. Top K Frequent Elements
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. sort the array and iterate to the kth element. This is O(n log n)

2. to be better, I have to avoid sort the array. then convert the array to {e:count} sort the dict according to count. very likely this is better than O(n log n)
```


my solution:
```
**********66ms
class Solution(object):
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        d = {}
        
        for n in nums:
            d[n] = d.get(n, 0) + 1
            
        res = sorted(d, key = d.get, reverse = True)
        return res[:k]
```
