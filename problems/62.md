62. Unique Paths
```
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. math. select m-1 right moves from (m-1)+(n-1) total moves: (m-1+n-1)!/((m-1)!*(n-1)!)

time: O(min(m,n)); space: O(1)

2. dp. 2d dp is straight forward. 1d dp needs a little tweek.
time: O(n*m); space: O(n) --1d
	  O(n*m); 		 O(n*m) --2d
```

my solution:
```
**********58 ms
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if m>n:
            m,n = n,m
        i = 1
        a = 1
        b = 1
        while i<m:
            a *= (m+n-1-i)
            b *= i
            i += 1
        return a//b
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. 2d dp, 105ms:
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """      
        mx=[]
        for i in range(0, m):
            for j in range(0, n):
                if j==0:
                    mx.append([1])
                elif i==0:
                    mx[i]=mx[i]+[1]
                elif i!=0:
                    mx[i]=mx[i]+[mx[i][j-1]+mx[i-1][j]]
                    
        return mx[m-1][n-1]
```
