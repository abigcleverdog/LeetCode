676. Implement Magic Dictionary
```
Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.

For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify exactly one character into another character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
Note:
You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. store the len of each word in the dict, if the len of the word we are searching for is not in the set, return false.
for each w in the dict, we mark off a char to generate a key, put the value of the key to be the w, if the key has not been generated before; if the key has been generated from another w, then this key is gold (if the word we are searching can generate this key, return True)
when searching, check the len of the word, then generate keys from the word, if the key is found, check if the key value matches the word, as we have to avoid searching for the identical word.
```


my solution:
```

class MagicDictionary(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.sl = set()
        self.dw = {}

    def buildDict(self, dict):
        """

        for word in dict:
            self.sl.add(len(word))
            if len(word) == 1:
                key = ' '
                if key not in self.dw:
                    self.dw[key] = word
                elif self.dw[key] != word:
                    self.dw[key] = '0'

                return True
        return False


# Your MagicDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MagicDictionary()
# obj.buildDict(dict)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)

from other ppl's solution:

1. I like this better than mine, 25ms:
class MagicDictionary(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        
        self.dic = {}
    def buildDict(self, dict):
        """
        Build a dictionary through a list of words
        :type dict: List[str]
        :rtype: void
        """
        for w in dict:
            self.dic[len(w)] = self.dic.get(len(w), []) + [w]
        

    def search(self, word):
        """
        Returns if there is any word in the trie that equals to the given word after modifying exactly one character
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for cand in self.dic.get(len(word), []):
            diff = 0
            
            for j in xrange(len(word)):
                if cand[j] != word[j]:
                    diff += 1
            if diff == 1:
                return True
        return False
