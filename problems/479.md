479. Largest Palindrome Product
```
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

Example:

Input: 2

Output: 987

Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987

Note:

The range of n is [1,8].
```

my thoughts:
```
1. find the biggest palindrome and see if it is a product of two n-digits. if not find the second biggest palindrome ...
```

my comments:

from other ppl's solution:

1. Thanks to @nizametdinov 's reply in this thread, I came out below solution.
Because i^2 - a*i - lower = 0
thus, (i-a/2)^2 = (4*lower-a^2)/2
thus, i.f.f. (4*lower-a^2)/2 is some integer's square, can lower i^2 - a*i - lower = 0 have integer result.
so I use (a^2-4*lo)^.5 == int((a^2-4*lo)^.5) to check.

class Solution(object):
    def largestPalindrome(self, n):
        if n==1: return 9
        if n==2: return 987
        for a in xrange(2, 9*10**(n-1)):
            hi=(10**n)-a
            lo=int(str(hi)[::-1])
            if a**2-4*lo < 0: continue
            if (a**2-4*lo)**.5 == int((a**2-4*lo)**.5):
                return (lo+10**n*(10**n-a))%1337
				
Original post:
I used the following approach. Let's denote the biggest palindrome product as palindrome = M * L. For N > 1 this palidrome has even number of digits and it can be represented as the sum:
palindrome = upper * 10^N + lower
We can expect that M and L are close to 10^N and we can represent them as M = 10^N - i, L = 10^N - j and hence
palindrome = (10^N - i) * (10^N - j) = 10^N * (10^N - (i + j)) + i * j
If we assume that i * j < 10^N (this assumption turned out to be true for N > 1) we can represent upper and lower in the following way:
upper = 10^N - (i + j)
lower = i * j
This is the system of equations which can be solved if we know upper and lower. Let's denote sum of i and j as a = i + j. It can be calculated as a = 10^N - upper. Because j = a - i equation for lower can be rewritten as
lower = a * i - i * i
This is a quadratic equation which can be solved using standard methods from textbooks.

Here is the algorithm:

if n == 1:
    return 9

for a in xrange(2, 9 * 10**(n-1)):
    upper = 10**n - a
    lower = reverseNumber(upper)
    # solve the equation 
    # lower == a * i - i * i
    # if it has whole number solution then
    #     return (10**n - i) * (10**n - j) % 1337
This solution is under 100ms but it is still slower than 40% of solutions. So there might be a better approach.

*why upper bound of a is 9 * 10**(n-1) rather than 18* 10**(n-1)?
* if a > 9 * 10**(n-1) then upper = 10**n - a will have less than n digits. This approach won't work in this case.
