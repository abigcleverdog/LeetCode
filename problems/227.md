227. Basic Calculator II
```
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:
"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5
Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.

********** 
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        s = s.replace(' ', '')
        if not s or len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        num = i = res = 0
        stack = []
        sign = 1
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i].isdigit():
                num = num*10 + int(s[i])
            elif s[i] in '+-':
                res += sign * num
                num = 0
                sign = 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
            elif s[i] in '/*':
                j = i+1
                temp = 0
                while j < len(s) and s[j].isdigit():
                    temp = temp * 10 + int(s[j])
                    j += 1
                num = num // temp if s[i] == '/' else num * temp
                #print(num, temp, i, j)
                i = j-1
                
            i += 1
        res += sign * num
        return res
