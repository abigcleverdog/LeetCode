537. Complex Number Multiplication
```
Given two strings representing two complex numbers.

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.

Example 1:
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
Example 2:
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
Note:

The input strings will not have extra blank.
The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. follow the definition.

my solution:
```
**********29ms
class Solution(object):
    def complexNumberMultiply(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: str
        :type b: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        aa = int(a.split('+')[0])
        ab = int(a.split('+')[1][:-1])
        ba = int(b.split('+')[0])
        bb = int(b.split('+')[1][:-1])
        ca = aa * ba - ab * bb
        cb = ab * ba + bb * aa
        return str(ca) + '+' + str(cb) + 'i'
