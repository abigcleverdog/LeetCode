605. Can Place Flowers
```
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
Note:
The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. trim the edges till 1's are found (if 1 cannot be found, count +1) between the 1's, find the continueous 0's. 
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. put a 0 in front and at the end of the arr, then count continueous 0's, 42ms:
class Solution(object):
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed, n):
        """
        :type flowerbed: List[int]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        count = 0
        curr_zeros = 0
        for flower in [0] + flowerbed + [0]:
            if flower == 1:
                if curr_zeros > 2:
                    count += (curr_zeros / 2) - (1 if curr_zeros % 2 == 0 else 0)
                curr_zeros = 0
            else:
                curr_zeros += 1
        
        if curr_zeros > 2:
            count += (curr_zeros / 2) - (1 if curr_zeros % 2 == 0 else 0)
        
        return count >= n
