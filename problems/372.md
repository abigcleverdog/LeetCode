372. Super Pow
```
Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

Example1:

a = 2
b = [3]

Result: 8
Example2:

a = 2
b = [1,0]

Result: 1024

my thoughts:
```
1. recursion.
```

my solution:
```
**********  
class Solution:
    def superPow(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: int
        :type b: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if a == 1:
            return 1
        if len(b) == 1:
            return a ** b[0] % 1337
        c = a ** b[-1] % 1337
        d = self.superPow(a, b[:-1])
        return c * (d ** 10) % 1337
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. Solution 1: Using Python’s big integers (accepted in 72 ms)
Turn b into a Python integer object (they grow arbitrarily large) and just use the pow function (which supports a modulo paramenter).

def superPow(self, a, b):
    return pow(a, int(''.join(map(str, b))), 1337)

## Solution 2: Using small ints (accepted in 80 ms)
Originally I went backwards (see solution 5) but then I saw other people go forwards and it’s simpler. Sigh. Anyway… my version:

def superPow(self, a, b):
    result = 1
    for digit in b:
        result = pow(result, 10, 1337) * pow(a, digit, 1337) % 1337
    return result
Explanation: For example for a5347, the above computes a5, then a53, then a534, and then finally a5347. And a step from one to the next can be done like a5347 = (a534)10 * a7.


## Solution 3: Using recursion (accepted in 92 ms)
Obligatory recursive oneliner version of solution 2.

def superPow(self, a, b):
    return pow(a, b.pop(), 1337) * pow(self.superPow(a, b), 10, 1337) % 1337 if b else 1

## Solution 4: Using `reduce` (accepted in 80 ms)
Obligatory reduce-oneliner version of solution 2.

def superPow(self, a, b):
    return reduce(lambda result, digit: pow(result, 10, 1337) * pow(a, digit, 1337) % 1337, b, 1)

## Solution 5: omg was i stupid (accepted in 72 ms)
My original do-it-yourself before I saw other people’s solutions and wrote solutions 2-4.

Using only small ints, also accepted in 72 ms:

def superPow(self, a, b):
    result = 1
    apower = a
    for digit in reversed(b):
        result = result * pow(apower, digit, 1337) % 1337
        apower = pow(apower, 10, 1337)
    return result
Explanation by example:

a5347
= a5000 * a300 * a40 * a7
= (a1000)5 * (a100)3 * (a10)4 * a7
= (((a10)10)10)5 * ((a10)10)3 * (a10)4 * a7

Computing that from back to front is straightforward (or straightbackward?).
