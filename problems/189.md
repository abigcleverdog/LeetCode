189. Rotate Array
```
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:

my thoughts:
```
1. nums = xyz  won't change the old value of nums,
   nums[:] = xyz will wipe the old memory
```


my solution:
```
**********89ms
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k = k%len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
```
