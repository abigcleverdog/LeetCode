503. Next Greater Element II
```
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. Brutal force: iterate the array, for each n, search for the next greater element. Time O(n^2)

2. use a stack to keep the cur decreasing sequence, one the trend start turning to increase, check from the back of the stack to populate of the idx of smaller element with current element. default in the res[] should be -1. at the end of the array set the last val of res to be the same as res[0], leave the rest to be -1.
time O(n)
```


my solution:
```
**********309ms
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not nums:
            return []
        l = len(nums)
        res = [-1]*len(nums)
        nums = nums+nums
        st = []
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            while st and n>st[-1][0]:
                temp = st.pop()
                res[temp[1]] = n

            if i<l:
                st.append( (n, i) )
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. did not really read through this one, seems instead of a stack of tuples, it uses two array to keep track of val and idx independently:
public class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int[] r = new int[nums.length];
        if(nums.length == 0) return r;
        Arrays.fill(r, -1);
        int[] N = new int[nums.length];
        int[] P = new int[nums.length]; 
        N[0] = nums[0];
        P[0] = 0;
        int p = 0, l = 2 * r.length;
        for(int i = 1; i < l - 1; ++i){
            int ri = i % r.length;
            if(nums[ri] <= N[p]){
                if(++p >= r.length) break;
                N[p] = nums[ri];
                P[p] = ri;
            } else {
                while(p >= 0 && N[p] < nums[ri]){
                    r[P[p]] = nums[ri];
                    --p;
                }
                N[++p] = nums[ri];
                P[p] = ri;
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
