115. Distinct Subsequences
```
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

Return 3.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. looks like dp.
	''		a		a		a		b
''	1		1		1		1		1
a	0		X1		X2		X3		X4
a	0		0		X5		X6		X7
b	0		0		0		X8		X9
b	0		0		0		0		XX

X1-X3: s == t, we can either delete this char from s or keep it,
	so X1 = 1+0 = 1; X2 = 2; X3 = 3
X4: s != t, we have to delete this char from s, X4 = X3 = 3
X5,X6: s == t, X5 = X1+0 = 1, X6 = X2+X5 = 3
X7 = X6 = 3
X8 = 0
X9 = X6+X8 = 3
XX = X8+0 = 0
```

my solution:
```
**********136ms
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return 0
        if not t:
            return 1
        
        ls = len(s)
        lt = len(t)
        dp = [[0]*(ls+1) for i in range(lt+1)]
        for i in range(ls+1):
            dp[0][i] = 1
        for i in range(1, lt+1):
            for j in range(i, ls+1):
                if s[j-1] == t[i-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
                    
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. 1d dp, 122ms:
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(t)
        res = [0]*(m)
        for c in s:
            for j in range(m-1, -1, -1):
                if c == t[j]:
                    res[j] += 1 if j==0 else res[j-1]
        return res[m-1]
