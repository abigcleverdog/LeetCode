84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
```
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.


Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].


The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

For example,
Given heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. for each height, find its max width and calc the area.
O(n^2) TLE

2. the slow part in 1 is to find the max width. eg [1,1,1,1,1] I will have to scan 5*5 times. to optimize this, divide the task into find the right bound for each and then the left bound for each (once a val smaller than i is found at j, it has to be smaller than everything between i to j-1)
* eg [1,2,3,4,5,3,4,5,2,1,3]
from left: 1 has 0 left, 2 has 0, 3 has 0 ... 5 has 0; 3 has 1+1+1 = 3 (till a smalller num is found), 4 has 0, 5 has 0, 2 has 1+1+3+1+1 = 7 (so that we do not have to redo 3's left), 1 has 1+7+1 = 9 (till idx out of range), 3 has 0
from right: 
O(n)
```

my solution:
```

my comments:
```

using stack to track left bounds.

from other ppl's solution:

1. very neat coding, 76ms:
def largestRectangleArea(self, height):
    height.append(0)
    stack = [-1]
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(len(height)):
        while height[i] < height[stack[-1]]:
            h = height[stack.pop()]
            w = i - stack[-1] - 1
            ans = max(ans, h * w)
        stack.append(i)
    height.pop()
    return ans
```
