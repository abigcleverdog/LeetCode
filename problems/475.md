475. Heaters
```
Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.

So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.

Note:
Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3],[2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. sort both arrs. if a house is between two heaters, find the min distance, if there are houses on beyond the first or the last heater, check how far we need to reach out. update coverage range while iterating the houses.
```


my solution:

class Solution(object):
    def findRadius(self, houses, heaters):
        """
        :type houses: List[int]
        :type heaters: List[int]
        :rtype: int

        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        res = 0
        i = 0
        j = 0
        l_ho = len(houses)
        l_he = len(heaters)
        if houses[0] < heaters[0]:
            res = heaters[0] - houses[0]
            while i < l_ho and houses[i] < heaters[0]:
                i += 1
        while i < l_ho and j < l_he-1:
            if houses[i] > heaters[j+1]:
                j += 1
            else:
                c = min(houses[i] - heaters[j],  heaters[j+1] - houses[i])
                if c > res:
                    res = c
                i += 1
        if i < l_ho:
            c = houses[-1]-heaters[-1]
            res = c if c>res else res
        return res

from other ppl's solution:

1. almost the same idea, but better language implementation cuts the time in half, 109ms:
class Solution(object):
    def findRadius(self, houses, heaters):
        """
        :type houses: List[int]
        :type heaters: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        i, j = 0, 0
        radius = 0

        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        
        while i < len(houses):
            while j < len(heaters) and heaters[j] < houses[i]:
                j += 1

            if j == len(heaters): # all heaters are on the left of houses[i]
                radius = max(radius, houses[-1] - heaters[-1])
                return radius
            
            if heaters[j] > houses[i]:
                if j == 0 : # all heaters are on the right of houses[i]
                    radius = max(radius, heaters[j] - houses[i])
                    # heaters[j-1] < houses[i]
                else: # j > 0 and heaters[j-1] < houses[i]
                    radius = max(radius, min(houses[i] - heaters[j-1], heaters[j] - houses[i]))

            i += 1

        return radius
```
