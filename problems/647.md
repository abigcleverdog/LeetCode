647. Palindromic Substrings
```
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
Note:
The input string length won't exceed 1000.
```

my thoughts:
```
1. count palindroms centered at each char and sum up. tricky part is the gap between two chars need to be checked for palindroms of even chars.
```


my solution:
```
**********206ms
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        def cp(i):
            l = min(i, len(s)-1-i)
            count = 0 if s[i] == '.' else 1
            j = 1 if s[i] == '.' else 2
            while j<=l:
                if s[i-j] == s[i+j]:
                    count += 1
                    j += 2
                else:
                    break
            return count
        
        s = list(s)
        s = '.'.join(s)
        print s
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            res += cp(i)
        return res
```

my comments:
```

from other ppl's solution:

1. careful counting for continuous chars, 39ms:
** this is faster but seems like we are doing what the computer should be doing for them
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans = 0
        start = 0
        while start < len(s):
            end = start
            while end < len(s) and s[start] == s[end]:
                end += 1
            repeat = end - start
            temp = (1 + repeat) * repeat / 2
            left, right = start - 1, end
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                temp += 1
                left -= 1
                right += 1

            ans += temp
            start = end

        return ans
		
2. for each char check odd pal and even pal, java solution:
int count =1;
public int countSubstrings(String s) {
    if(s.length()==0) 
        return 0;
    for(int i=0; i<s.length()-1; i++){
        checkPalindrome(s,i,i);     //To check the palindrome of odd length palindromic sub-string
        checkPalindrome(s,i,i+1);   //To check the palindrome of even length palindromic sub-string
    }
    return count;
}    

private void checkPalindrome(String s, int i, int j) {
    while(i>=0 && j<s.length() && s.charAt(i)==s.charAt(j)){    //Check for the palindrome string 
        count++;    //Increment the count if palindromin substring found
        i--;    //To trace string in left direction
        j++;    //To trace string in right direction
    }
}
```
