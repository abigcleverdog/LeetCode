215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
```
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
For example,
Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

my thoughts:
```
1. use heap to maintain min of the k pile.
```

my solution:
```
**********
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        h = []
        for i in range(k):
            heapq.heappush(h, nums[i])
            
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > h[0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(h, nums[i])
                
        return h[0]
```
